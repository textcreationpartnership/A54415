         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Charles I.</head>
            <p>CHARLES I. King of Great <hi>Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the Son of <hi>James</hi> VI. King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife a Daughter of <hi>Denmark.</hi> By His Father deſcended to him all the Rights (together with their blood) of all our Ancient both <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings to this Empire. For the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter and ſole Heir of <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> the laſt ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Prince of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Malcolme Conmor</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to his Line the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. married to <hi>James</hi> IV. did bring the <hi>Norman</hi> Titles and Blood. From this Imperial Extract He received not more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than He gave to it. For the blood that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104649:10"/>was derived to Him elaborated through ſo many Royal veins, He delivered to Poſterity more maturated for Glory, and by a conſtant practice of Goodneſs more habituated for Vertue.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> one of the principal Towns of <hi>Fife</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> on <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 19. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1600.] in ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that His Baptiſm was haſtened without the uſual Ceremonies wherewith ſuch Royal Infants are admitted into the Church. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeeming to conſecrate Him to Sufferings from the Womb, and to accuſtom Him to the exchange of the ſtrictures of Greatneſs for clouds of Tears.</p>
            <p>There was no obſervation nor augury made at His Birth concerning the ſequel of His Life or courſe of Fortune (which are uſually relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch whoſe lives have different occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from thoſe in others of the ſame ſtate.) Either the fear of His Death made thoſe about Him leſs obſervant of any Circumſtances which curious minds would have formed into a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, He appearing like a Star that riſes ſo near the point of his ſetting, that it was thought there would be no time for calculation. Or He being at diſtance by His Birth from the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown (Prince <hi>Henry</hi> then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt hopes) made men leſs ſolicitous to enquire of His future ſtate, on whom, being born to a private Condition, the Fate of the Kingdom did not depend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104649:10"/>But in the third year of His age, when King <hi>James</hi> was preparing himſelf to remove to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, a certain Laird of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> though of very great age, came to the Court to take his leave of him, whom he found accompanied with all his Children. After his addreſs full of affectionate and ſage Advice (to which his gray hairs gave authority) to the King; his next application was to Duke <hi>CHARLES</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1602.] (for in the ſecond year of His age He was created Duke of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Ardmanock</hi>) whoſe hands he kiſs'd with ſo great an ardencie of affection, that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forgetful of a ſeparation. The King, to correct his ſuppoſed miſtake, adviſed him to a more preſent obſervance of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> as the Heir of his Crown, of whom he had taken little notice. The old Laird anſwered that he knew well enough what he did, and that <hi>It was this Child</hi> (who was then in His Nurſes arms) <hi>who ſhould convey his name and memory to the ſucceeding ages.</hi> This then was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dotage; but the event gave it the credit of a Prophecie, and confirmed that opinion, <hi>That ſome long-experienced ſouls in the world, before their diſlodging, arrive to the height of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1603.] When He was three years old He was committed to the Care and Governance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104649:11"/>of Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi>'s Lady, as a reward for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Meſſenger of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s death, whoſe long life had worn the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nobility into a ſuſpicion, <hi>that the Lords of</hi> England <hi>would never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her to be dead as long as there was any old Woman of that Nation that could wear good cloaths, and perſonate the Majeſty of a Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1604.] In the fourth year, after He had wreſtled with a Feaver, He was brought in <hi>October</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where on <hi>January</hi> 6. following, having the day before been made <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Bath,</hi> He was inveſted with the Title of <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and in the ſixth year [<hi>Anno</hi> 1606.] was committed to the Pedagogy of Mr. <hi>Thomas Murray,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well qualified to that Office, though a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of Presbytery.</p>
            <p>Under this Tutor, and conſined to a retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the preſent weakneſs of His body, He was ſo diligent and ſtudious, that He far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in all that kind of Learning which is neceſſary for a Prince, <hi>without which even their natural Endowments ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em rough and unpleaſant in deſpight of the ſplendour of their Fortune.</hi> His proficiency in Letters was ſo eminent, that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> taking notice of it, to put a jeſt upon Him, one day put the Cap of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> (who was then, with the Prince and the Duke and other of the Nobility, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104649:11"/>in the Privy Chamber for the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out) on his Brother's head; adding, that <hi>If He continued a good Boy, and followed His book, he would make Him one day Archbiſhop of Canterbury.</hi> Which the Child took in ſuch diſdain, that He threw the Cap on the ground, and trampled it under His feet with ſo much eagerneſs, that He could hardly be reſtrained. Which Paſſion was afterward taken by ſome overcurious as a preſage of the ruine of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy by His Power. But the event ſhewed it was not ominous to the Order, but to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Archbiſhop, whom in His Reign He ſuſpended from the adminiſtration of His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1611.] In His eleventh year He was made Knight of the Garter: and in the twelfth Prince <hi>Henry</hi> dying <hi>November</hi> 6. [1612.] He ſucceeded him in the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and the Regalities thereof; and attended his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as chief Mouraer, on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>On the 14. of <hi>February</hi> following He perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Office of Brideman to the Princeſs <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> His Siſter, who on that day was married to <hi>Frederick</hi> V. Prince <hi>Elector Palatine;</hi> the gayeties of which day were afterwards attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many fatal Cares and Expences.</p>
            <p>His Childhood was blemiſhed with a ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Obſtinacy: for the weakneſs of His body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104649:12"/>Him to retirements, and the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His ſpeech rendring diſcourſe tedious and unpleaſant, He was ſuſpected to be ſomewhat perverſe. But more age and ſtrength fitting Him for manlike Exerciſes, and the Publick hopes inviting Him from His Privacies, He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the world of ſuch fears: for applying Himſelf to action, He grew ſo perfect in Vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riding the great Horſe, running at the Ring, ſhooting in Croſs-bows, Muskets, and ſometimes in great Pieces of Ordnance, that if Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had been to be the reward of Excellency in thoſe Arts, He would have had a Title to the Crown this way alſo; being thought the beſt Marks-man and moſt graceful Manager of the great Horſe in the three Kingdoms. His tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humor He left with His retirements, none being more deſirous of good counſel, nor any more obſequious when He found it; yea, too diſtruſtful of His own Judgment, which the iſſue of things proved always beſt when it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1616.] When he was ſixteen years old, on <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. He was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> the Revenues thereof being aſſigned to maintain His Court which was then formed for Him. And being thus advanced in Years and State, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that He ſhould no longer retain the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which the ſhades of His Privacy had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Him unto, but now appear as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104649:12"/>Inſtrument of Empire, and that by Him the Favours and Honours of the Court ſhould be derived to others. But though Providence had changed all about, yet it had changed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within Him; and He thought it glory enough to be great without the diminution of others; for He ſtill permitted the Miniſtry of State to His Fathers Favourites: which gave occaſion of diſcourſe to the <hi>Speculativi.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Some thought He did it to avoid the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of the Old King, (which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have been ſomewhat raiſed by the popularity of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> whoſe breaſt was full of forward Hopes) For <hi>Young Princes are deemed of an impatient Ambition, and Old ones to be too nice and tender of their Power; in which though they are contented with a Succeſſor (as they muſt have) yet are afraid of a Partner.</hi> And it was ſuppoſed that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore K. <hi>James</hi> had raiſed <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> like Comets to dim the luſtre of theſe riſing Stars. But theſe were miſtaken in the nature of that King, who was enclined to contract a private friendſhip,
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal to the objects of it, before ever he had Sons to divert his Love, or raiſe his Fears.</p>
               <p>Some that at a diſtance looked upon the Prince's actons, aſcribed them to a Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, and an Incapacity of Greatneſs:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104649:13"/>while others, better acquainted with the frame of His Spirit, knew His prudent Modeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined Him to learn the Methods of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding by the practice of Obedience; and that being of a peaceful Soul, He affected not to embroil the Court (and from thence the Kingdom) in Factions, (the effects of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent minds) which He knew were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to a State, and deſtructive to that Prince who gives birth unto them; that therefore He choſe to wait for a certain, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, Grandeur, rather than by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way of Contraſts get a precocious Power, and leave too pregnant an Example of Ruine.</p>
               <p>Others conceived it the Prudence of the Father (with which the Son complied) who knew the true uſe of Favourites was to make them the objects of the People's impatience, the ſinks to receive the curſes and anger of the Vulgar, the hatred of the querulous, and the envy of unſatisfied ambition: which He would rather have fall upon Servants, that His Son might aſcend the Throne free and unburthened with the diſcontents of any. This was the rather believed, becauſe He could diſpenſe Honours where and when He pleaſed; as He did to ſome of His own Houſhold; as Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi> was made Lord <hi>Cary</hi> of <hi>Lepington,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcount <hi>Andover,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Vaughan</hi> Lord of <hi>Molingar</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104649:13"/>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1618.] The evenneſs of His Spirit was diſcovered in the loſs of His Mother, whoſe death (preſaged, as ſome thought, by that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Comet which appeared <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) happened on <hi>March</hi> 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. which He bewailed with a juſt meaſure of Grief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any affected Sorrows, though She was moſt affectionate to Him above all her other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and at her Funeral He would be chief Mourner.</p>
            <p>The Death of the Queen was not long after followed with a ſharp Sickneſs of the King: wherein his Life ſeeming in danger, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of his Death began to be lamented. <q>Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> bewailed <hi>the ſad condition of the Church, if God ſhould at that time determine the days of the King. The Prince being then only converſant with</hi> Scotch-<hi>men, which made up the greateſt part of His Family, and were ill-affected to the Government and Worſhip of the Church of</hi> England.</q> Of this the King became ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he made a Vow, <q>
                  <hi>If God ſhould pleaſe to reſtore his health, he would ſo inſtruct the Prince in the Controverſies of Religion, as ſhould ſecure His affections to the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1619.] In his 19. Year, on <hi>March</hi> 24. which was the Anniverſary of King <hi>James</hi>'s coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> He perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Juſting at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> together with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Nobility, wherein He acquitted Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Bravery equal to His Dignity. And on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, attending His Father to the Sermon at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, and to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Quire, He ſhewed as much humble Devotion there, as he had manifeſted Princely Gallantry in his Juſts, admired and applauded by the People for His accompliſhments in the Arts both of War and Peace: That He could behave Himſelf humbly towards His God, and bravely towards His Enemy; pleaſed with the hardineſs of His Body, and raviſhed with His more generous Mind; that the pleaſures of the Court had not ſoftned one to Sloth, nor the ſupremeſt Fortune debauched the other to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1622.] Confident in theſe, and other evidences of a wiſe conduct, the King (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting his Council) ſends the Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> there to contract a Marriage with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and as a part of the Portion, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104649:14"/>recover the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which His Siſters Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had loſt, and was by the <hi>Emperour</hi> canteld to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> And herein He was to combate all the Artiſts of State in that Court, the practices of that Church, and put an iſſue to that Treaty wherein the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> though much converſant in the Intrigues of that Council, had been long cajoled.</p>
            <p>To that place He was to paſs <hi>Incognito,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with the Marqueſs of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Cottington,</hi> through <hi>France;</hi> where, to ſatisfie His Curioſity, and ſhew Himſelf to Love, He attempted and enjoyed a view of the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> and there received the firſt Impreſſion of that Excellent <hi>Princeſs</hi> who was by Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to His chaſt Embraces. Satisfied with that ſight, no leſſer enjoyments of any pleaſure in that great Kingdom, nor Vanity of Youth, which is hardly curbed when it is allyed to power, could tempt His ſtay, or a diſcovery of His Greatneſs; but with a ſpeed anſwerable to an active body and mind, He out-ſtripped the <hi>French</hi> Poſts which were ſent to ſtop Him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that King had intelligence of His being within his Dominions immediately after their departure from the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The certain news of His ſafe arrival at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> drew after Him from hence a Princely Train, and raiſed the Cenſures of the World
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104649:15"/>upon the King; <q>As being too forgetful of the Inhoſpitality of Princes to each other, who, when either Deſign, Tempeſts or Neceſſity have driven their Rivals in Majeſty upon their Coaſts without a Caution, they let them not part without ſome tribute to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and a freſh Example of this was in the King's own Mother, who ſeeking refuge in <hi>England</hi> with her Siſter Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from a Storm at home, did loſe both her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This none daring to mind the King of, his Jeſter <hi>Archee</hi> made him ſenſible, by telling him, <hi>He came to change Caps with him. Why,</hi> ſaid the King? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (replied <hi>Archee</hi>) <hi>Thou haſt ſent the Prince into</hi> Spain, <hi>from whence He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to return. But</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>what wilt thou ſay when thou ſeeſt Him come back again? Mary,</hi> ſaies the Jeſter, <hi>I will take off the Fools Cap which I now put upon thy head for ſending Him thither, and put it on the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s for letting Him return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſo awakened the King's apprehenſion of the Prince's danger, that it drove him into an exceeding Melancholy, from which he was never free till he was aſſured of the Prince's return to his own Dominions, which was his Fleet in the Sea: and that was not long after. For notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſts of his two prime Miniſters there, <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104649:15"/>and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (which were ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze an ordinary prudence, and diſturb the counſels of ſo young a beginner in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Empire, and the Arts of experienced Conclaves;) the impetuous attempts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Clergy, either for a Change of His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or a Toleration of theirs; the Spleen of <hi>Olivares,</hi> whom <hi>Buckingham</hi> had exaſperated; He ſo dexterouſly managed the Treaty of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that all the Articles and Circumſtances were ſolemnly ſworn to by both Kings. By a Civil Letter to the Pope (which His Enemies Malice afterwards took as an occaſion of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) He procured a civil return, with the grant of a Diſpenſation; baffled the hopes of their Clergy by His Conſtancy in his own Profeſſion, and vindicated it from the odious aſperſions of their Prieſts, by cauſing our Liturgie to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue; and by His ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous miene enthralled the <hi>Infanta,</hi> for whom He had expoſed His Liberty.</p>
            <p>Yet having an inſight into the practices of that Court, that they would not put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> into the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Portion, but reſerve it as a Super-foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Love, and as an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the <hi>Infanta</hi> to reconcile the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who were heated by the late Wars into an hatred of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that this was but to lengthen out the Treaty till they had wholly brought the <hi>Palatinate</hi> under their power; He
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104649:16"/>conformed His mind to the reſolves of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſaid, "<hi>He would never marry his Son with a Portion of His only Siſter's Tears,</hi> and therefore inclined to a rupture. But concealing His Purpoſe, and diſſembling His Knowledge of their Deſigns, He conſulted His own Safety and Return, which His Fathers Letters command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which He ſo prudently acquired, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> parted from Him with all thoſe endearments with which departing Friends cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniate their Farewels; having ſatisfied Him by a Proxie left with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to be delivered when the Diſpenſation was come. Which as ſoon as He was ſafe on Shipboard, by a private Expreſs, He commanded him to keep in his hands till further Order.</p>
            <p>[<hi>An.</hi> 1623.] His Return to <hi>England,</hi> which was in <hi>October</hi> 1623, was entertained with ſo much Joy and Thankſgiving, as if He had been the happy <hi>Genius</hi> of the whole Nation; and His entrance into <hi>London</hi> was as a Triumph for His Wiſdom, their Bonefires lengthened out the day, and their Bells by unceſſant ringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad ſleep to thoſe eyes which were refreſhed with His ſight. Nor could the People by age or ſickneſs be confined at home, but deſpiſing the preſcriptions of their Phyſicians, went to meet Him as reſtored Health.</p>
            <p>When He had given the King an account of His Voyage, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels not to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104649:16"/>reſtore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> was Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, which was ſo zealous of the Honour of the Prince, that both Houſes Voted an Addreſs to His Majeſty, that he would no longer Treat, but begin a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and deſiring the Prince's Mediation (who was alwayes ready to gratifie the Nation) therein to His Father, they aſſured Him they would ſtand by Him with their Lives and Fortunes: but yet when the War, with the Crown, deſcended unto Him, they ſhamefully deſerted Him in the beginning of His Reign.</p>
            <p>When neither a Wife nor Peace was any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> both were ſought for from <hi>France,</hi> by a Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> the youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. The Love of whom the Prince had received by the Eye, and She of Him by the Ear. For having formerly received impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the Relations of His Gallantry; when She was told of His paſſing through <hi>Paris,</hi> She anſwered (as it is reported) That <hi>if He went to</hi> Spain <hi>for a Wife, He might have had one nearer hand, and ſaved Himſelf a great part of the labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1625.] In the midſt of theſe Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for War and Love, King <hi>James</hi> died at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> Sunday <hi>March</hi> 27. <hi>Anno</hi> 1625. and Prince <hi>CHARLES</hi> was immediately proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Court-Gate <hi>King of Great Britain,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104649:17"/>France and Ireland,</hi> and ſo throughout all the Three Kingdoms, with inſinite Rejoycings.

            <p>His firſt publick Act was the Celebrating His Fathers Funeral, whereat He Himſelf was Chief Mourner, (contrary to the Practice of His Royal Predeceſſors, and not conformable to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of State;) Either preferring Piety to an unnatural Grandeur; or urged by ſome ſecret Decree of Providence, that in all the ruines of His Family He ſhould drink the greateſt draught
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104649:17"/>of Tears; or His Spirit preſaging the Troubles of the Throne, He would hallow the Aſcent to it by a pious act of Grief.</p>
            <p>When He had pay'd that debt to His deceaſed Father, He next provided for Poſterity, and therefore haſtened the coming over of His dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſort, Whom the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> had in His Name eſpouſed at the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> and He receiving Her at <hi>Dover</hi> the next day after <hi>Trinity</hi>-Sunday; at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> began His Conjugal Embraces. A Lady of moſt excellent Endowments, who aſſumed to Her ſelf nothing in His Good Fortune but the Joy; and in His Evil bore an equal ſhare, for She reverenced Him, not his Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſpatched the affairs of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, He applyes Himſelf to thoſe of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which too much Felicity had made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable by a moderate Government. And He ſeemed not ſo much to aſcend a Throne, as enter upon a Theatre, to wreſtle with all the difficulties of a corrupted State; whoſe long Peace had ſoftned almoſt all the Nobleſs into Court-pleaſures, and made the Commons inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by a great Plenty. The Rites and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Religion had been blotted out by a long and uninterrupted Proſperity, and Factions crept from the Church into the Senate, which were made uſe of by thoſe that endeavoured the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Government; and the Reſolves of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104649:18"/>that Council were the dictates of ſome heady Demagogues, who fed the Vulgar with hopes of Novelty under the name of Liberty, ſo that the King could not endure their Vices, nor they His Vertues: whence came all the Obſtructions to His Deſigns for Glory and the Publick good. The Treaſury had been exhauſted to ſatiate the unquiet and greedy <hi>Scots:</hi> and the people were taught not to ſupply it, unleſs they were bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the blood of ſome Miniſter of State, or ſome more advantages for Licentiouſneſs. Each of theſe ſingle would have ennobled the Care of an Ordinary Prudence to have weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out: but when all theſe conſpired with the traitorous Projects of men of unbounded and unlawful hopes, they took from Him His Peace, and that which the World calls Happineſs; but yet they made Him Great, and affording Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes for His moſt excellent Abilities rendred Him Glorious.</p>
            <p>The different ſtates of theſe Difficulties, when like Clouds they were gathering together, and when they deſcended in ſhowres of Blood, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the King's Reign into two parts. The firſt could not be eſteemed dayes of Peace, but an Immunity from Civil War. The other was when He was concluded by that Fatal Neceſſity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to part with his Dignity, and expoſe His Subjects to the injuries of numerous Tyrants; or elſe to exceed the calmer temper of His peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Soul, and make uſe of thoſe neceſſary Arms,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104649:18"/>whereby He might hope to divert, if poſſible, the Ruine of Church and State which He ſaw in projection.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Part He had no Wars at home but what was in the Houſes of Parliament; which though their firſt Inſtitution deſigned for the production of juſt Counſels, and aſſiſtances of Government, yet, through the juſt Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven, and the practiſes of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and ſeditious perſons, became the wombs wherein were firſt conceived and formed thoſe monſtrous Confuſions which deſtroyed their own Liberty, cauſed our Miſeries, and the King's Afflictions.</p>
            <p>His Firſt Parliament began <hi>June</hi> 18. At the opening of which the <hi>King</hi> acquainted them with the neceſſity of Supplies for the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which they importunately had through His Mediation engaged His Father in, and made it as hereditary to Him as the Crown. His Eloquence gave powerful Reaſons for ſpeedy and large ſumms of Money; did alſo audit to them the ſeveral disburſements relating both to the Army and Navy, that He might remove all Jealouſies of miſ-imployment, and give them notice how well He underſtood the Office He had newly entred upon, and how to be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward of the Publick Treaſure. But the Projectors of the alteration of Government brought into debate two Petitions, one for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104649:19"/>Religion, the other for Grievances, formed in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, which delayed the Succours, and increaſed the Neceſſities, which at laſt they anſwered but with two Subſidies, too poor a ſtock to furniſh an Army with; yet was kindly accepted, in expectation of more at the next Seſſion. For the Infection ſeiſing upon <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament was adjourned till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when they were to meet at <hi>Oxford:</hi> and at that time He paſſed ſuch Acts as were preſented to Him.</p>
            <p>At the next Seſſion He gave a complying and ſatisfactory anſwer to all their Petitions, and expected a Retribution in larger Subſidies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War. But in ſtead of theſe, there were high and furious debates of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, conſultations to form and publiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, Accuſations of the <hi>Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham:</hi> Which the King eſteeming as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of His Government, and aſſaults upon Monarchy, diſſolves that Aſlembly, hoping to find one of a leſs cholerick complexion after His Coronation.</p>
            <p>This inauſpicious Meeting drew aſter it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſchief, the Miſcarriage of the Deſigns upon <hi>Spain.</hi> For the ſupplies of Money being ſcanty and ſlow, the Fleet could not go forth till <hi>October</hi> 8. an unſeaſonable time in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Seas; and their firſt conteſt was with Winds and Tempeſts, which deſtroying ſome, ſeatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104649:19"/>all the Ships. When they met, a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtorm fell among the Soldiers and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where ſmall Pay cauſed leſs Diſcipline, and a contempt of their General, the Lord <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> rendred the attempt upon <hi>Cades</hi> vain and fruitleſs. This was followed by a Contagion (to which ſome conceive diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented minds make the bodies of men more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious) in the Navy, which forced it home, more empty of Men, and leſs of Reputation.</p>
            <p>The Infection decreaſing at <hi>London,</hi> the King performed the Solemnities of His Coronation <hi>February</hi> 2. with ſome alterations from thoſe of His Predeceſſors: for in the Civil He omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the uſual Parade of Riding from the <hi>Tower</hi> through the City to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to ſave the Expences that Pomp required, for more noble undertakings. In the Spiritual there was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Clauſe in the Prayers which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted ſince <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and was this; <hi>Let Him obtain favour for this People, like</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the waters,</hi> Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias <hi>in the Temple; give Him</hi> Peter<hi>'s Key of Diſcipline,</hi> Paul<hi>'s Doctrine.</hi> Which though more agreeing to the Principles of <hi>Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> which acknowledgeth the Power of Princes in their Churches, and was therefore omitted in the times of Popery; yet was quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at by the Factious party, (who take advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Calumny and Sedition from good as well as bad circumſtances) and condemned as a new
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104649:20"/>invention of Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and made uſe of to defame both the King and him.</p>
            <p>After this He began a Second Parliament <hi>February</hi> 2. wherein the Commons voted Him Four Subſidies, but the Demagogues intended them as the price of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s blood; whom Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> and Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> with ſo much bitterneſs inveighed againſt, as paſſing the modeſty of their former diſſimulation they taxed the King's Government. Sir <hi>Dudley Digges,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> and others carried up Articles againſt him to the Lord's Houſe, in which, to make the Faction more ſport, the Duke and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> did mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach each other. By theſe contraſts the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were ſo highly heated, that the Faction thought it fit time to put a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> in the forge, which according to their manner was to be a publick Invective againſt the Government. But the <hi>King</hi> having notice of it, diſſolves the Parliament <hi>June</hi> 18. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1626.] and the Bill for the Subſidies never paſſed.</p>
            <p>This miſunderſtanding at home produced another War abroad. For the King of <hi>France</hi> taking advantage of theſe our Domeſtick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broilments begins a War upon us, and ſeiſeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant Ships in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> His pretence was, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> had ſent back all the <hi>French</hi> Servants of the Queen, whoſe inſolencies had been intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104649:20"/>But the world ſaw the vanity of this pretext in the Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf, who had in the like manner dimitted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of his own Queen: and that truly the unhappy Counſels in Parliament had expoſed this Juſt Prince to foreign injuries. Which He magnanimouſly endeavoured to revenge, and to recover the goods of His abuſed Subjects; and therefore ſent the Fleet deſigned for Juſtice upon <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeek it firſt in <hi>France.</hi> But the want of Money made the Preparations ſlow; and therefore the Navy putting out late in the year was by Storms forced to deſiſt the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. So that what was the effect only of the malice of His Enemies, was imputed by ſome to a ſecret Decree of Heaven, which obſtructed His juſt undertakings for Glory.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1627.] The next year the <hi>King,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Petitions of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who now ſued for His Protection, as well as by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of His own Cauſe, more early proſecuted His Counſels, and ſent the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to attach the Iſle of <hi>Rhee;</hi> which though alarmed to a greater ſtrength by the laſt year's vain attempt, yet had now ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, had not the Duke managed that War more with the Gayeties of a Courtier than the Arts of a Souldier. And when it was wiſdom to forſake thoſe attempts which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer neglects had made impoſſible, being too greedy of Honour, and to avoid the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104649:21"/>on of fear in a ſafe retreat, he loaded his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw with a new Ignominy, and an heavier loſs of men, (the common fate of thoſe <hi>Who ſeek for glory in the parcels, loſe it in the groſs.</hi>) Which was contrary to the temper of his Maſter, who was ſo tender of humane blood, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He raiſed no Wars, but found them; and thought it <hi>an opprobrious bargain to purchaſe the fruitleſs Laurels, or the empty name of Honour, with the lives of men, but where the Publick Safety required the hazard and loſs of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Expedition being ſo unhappy, and the Miſeries of <hi>Rochel</hi> making them importunate for the <hi>King</hi>'s Aſſiſtance, His Compaſſionate Soul was deſirous to remove their Dangers, but was reſtrained by that neceſſitous condition the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had concluded Him under. To free Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from which, that He might deliver the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, He doth pawn His own Lands for 120000 pounds to the <hi>City,</hi> and borrows 30000 pounds more of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: but this was yet too narrow a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupport the charges of the Fleet, and no way ſo natural to get adequate ſupplies as by a Parliament; which He therefore ſummons to meet <hi>March</hi> 17, intending to uſe all Methods of Complacency to unite the Subjects Affections, to Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Which in the beginning proved ſucceſsful,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104649:21"/>for the modeſty of the Subjects ſtrove with the Piety of the <hi>King,</hi> and both Intereſts contended to oblige, that they might be obliged. The Parliament granted the <hi>King</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1628.] five Subſidies, and He freely granted their Petition of Right, the greateſt Condeſcenſion that ever any <hi>King</hi> made, wherein He ſeemed to ſubmit the Royal Scepter to the Popular <hi>Faſces,</hi> and to have given Satisfaction even to Supererogation.</p>
            <p>Theſe auſpicious beginnings, though full of Joy both to Prince and People, were matter of envy to the Faction; and therefore to form new Diſcontents and Jealouſies, the Demagogues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Houſes that the <hi>King</hi>'s Grant of their Petition extended, (beyond their own Hopes and the Limits themſelves had ſet, and what He had expreſly mentioned and caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) even to the taking away His Right to <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Beſides this, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain hammering a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to reproach Him and His Miniſters of male-adminiſtration. Which Ingratitude He being not able to endure, on <hi>June</hi> 26. adjourns the Parliament till <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. and afterward by Proclamation till <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. following.</p>
            <p>In the interim, the <hi>King</hi> haſtens to ſend ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to <hi>Rochel:</hi> and though the General, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by <hi>Felton,</hi> armed (as he profeſſed) with the publick hatred; yet the Preparations were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104649:22"/>not ſlackned, the <hi>King</hi> by His perſonal induſtry doing more to the neceſſary furniſhing of the Fleet in ten or twelve dayes than the Duke had done in ſo many months before. But in the mean while <hi>Rochel</hi> was barricadoed to an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Relief. Therefore the Earl of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> who commanded the Forces, after ſome gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, yet fruitleſs attempts returned to <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to the Obedience of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>As Providence had removed the great Object of the Popular hate, and (as was pretended) the chief obſtruction of the Subjects Love to their <hi>King,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> ſo the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf labours to remove all other occaſions of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel before the next Seſſion. He reſtores Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who for his remiſneſs in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church had been ſuſpended from his Office, and was therefore the Darling of the Commons becauſe in diſgrace with the <hi>King,</hi> (ſo <hi>contrary are the affections of a corrupted State to thoſe of their Governours</hi>) to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it again. Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> the great <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Book of <hi>Appello Caeſarem</hi> was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in. Proclamations were iſſued out againſt Papiſts. Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> an active Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Commons, was towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Seſſion, as Sir <hi>John Savil</hi> had been at the end of the laſt, called up into the Lord's Houſe, being made Viſcount <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> of the North.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104649:22"/>But the Honours of theſe Perſons (whoſe parts the <hi>King,</hi> who well underſtood men, thought worthy of his Favour and Employment) ſeeming the rewards of Sedition, and the ſpoils of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Counſels, the Demagogues were more eager in the purſuit of that which theſe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, by the like Arts. And therefore deſpiſing all the <hi>King</hi>'s obliging practices, in the next Seſſions they aſſumed a power of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church and State, called the Cuſtomers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion for Levying <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> made now their Invectives, as they formerly did againſt the Duke, againſt the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton;</hi> ſo that it appeared that not the perſons of men, but the <hi>King</hi>'s truſt of them, was the object of their Envy, and His Favour, though never ſo Vertuous, marked them out for Ruine. And upon theſe points they raiſed the heat to ſuch a degree, that fearing they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ere they had time to vent their paſſions, they began a Violence upon their own Body (an example which laſted longer than their Cauſe, and at laſt produced the overthrow of all their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.) They lockt the Doors of the Houſe, kept the Key thereof in one of their own Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, held the Speaker by ſtrong hand in the Chair, till they had thundred out their Votes, like dreadfull <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> againſt thoſe that ſhould Levy, and, which was more ranting, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as ſhould willingly pay the <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> This Force the <hi>King</hi> went with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104649:23"/>His Guard of Penſioners to remove; which they hearing, adjourned the Houſe; and the <hi>King</hi> in the Houſe of Lords declaring the Injuſtice of thoſe Vipers who deſtroyed their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſſolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>While the winds of Sedition raged thus furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly at home, more gentle gales came from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. The <hi>French</hi> King's deſigns upon other places required Peace from us, and therefore the Signiorie of <hi>Venice</hi> by her Ambaſſadors was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to procure an Accord betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Lewis;</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> accepted. And not long after [<hi>Anno</hi> 1629.] the <hi>Spaniard</hi> preſſed with equal neceſſities deſired Amity; which was alſo granted. The <hi>King</hi> being thus freed from His domeſtick Embroilments and foreign Enmities, ſoon made the World ſee His Skill in the Arts of Empire, and rendred Himſelf abroad more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than any of His Predeceſſors. And He was more glorious in the eyes of the good, and more ſatisfied in His own breaſt, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Peace with Prudence, than if He had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Wars with deſtroying Arms. So that His Sceptre was the <hi>Caduceus</hi> to arbitrate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi> His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects likewiſe taſted the ſweetneſs of a Reign which Heaven did indulge with all its favours, but only that of valuing their Happineſs. While other Nations weltred in blood, His people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a profound Peace, and that Plenty which the freedom of Commerce brings along with it.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104649:23"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> uſed <hi>London</hi> as the ſureſt Bank to preſerve and increaſe their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bullion was here Coined, which advantaged the <hi>King</hi>'s Mint, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Wealth of the Merchants, who returned moſt of that Money in our native Commodities.</p>
            <p>While He diſpenſed theſe Bleſſings to the People, Heaven was liberal to Him in giving Him a Son to inherit His Dominions, <hi>May</hi> 29. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1630.] which was ſo great matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to the People of uncorrupted minds, that Heaven ſeemed alſo concerned in the Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, kindling another Fire more than Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, making a <hi>Star</hi> to be ſeen the ſame day at noon. (From which moſt men preſaged that that Prince ſhould be of high Undertakings, and of no common glory among Kings: which hath ſince been confirmed by the miraculous preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Him, and Heaven ſeemed to conduct Him to the Throne.) For this great bleſſing the <hi>King</hi> gave publick Thanks to the Author of it, Almighty God, at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church; and God was pleaſed in a return to thoſe thanks with a numerous Iſſue afterwards to increaſe this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. <hi>For neither Armies nor Navies are ſuch ſure props of Empire as Children are. Time, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, private Luſts, or Errors may take off, or change Friends: but thoſe that Nature hath united muſt have the ſame Intereſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Royal Families, in whoſe Proſperities ſtrangers may have a part, but their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104649:24"/>will be ſure to cruſh their nearest Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proſpering thus in Peace at home, a ſmall time aſſiſted His frugality to get ſuch a Treaſure, and gave Him leaſure to form ſuch Counſels as might curb the Inſolence of His Enemies abroad. He confederated with other Princes to give a check to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs, aſſiſting by His Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Arms and Counſel, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to deliver the oppreſſed <hi>German</hi> States from the Imperial Oppreſſions. And when <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s fortune made him inſolent, and he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unequal Conditions upon the <hi>Paltſgrave,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Brother in Law, He neceſſitated him notwithſtanding his Victories to more eaſie Articles.</p>
            <p>The next year was notorious for two Trials: one of the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> who being accuſed by all the abuſed parts of his Family of a prodigious wickedneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural uncleanneſs, was by the <hi>King</hi> ſubmitted to a tryal by his Peers, and by them being found Guilty, was Condemned, and his Nobility could be no patronage for his Crimes; (but in the King's eyes they appeared more horrid, becauſe they polluted that Order) and was afterwards executed.</p>
            <p>The other was of a tryal of Combate at a Marſhal's Court, betwixt <hi>Donnold</hi> Lord <hi>Rey,</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh High-lander,</hi> and <hi>David Ramſey,</hi> a <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:104649:24"/>Courtier. <q>The firſt accuſed the laſt to have ſolicited him to a Confederacy with the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of ſome Forces in aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> in which <hi>Ramſey</hi> ſaid all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was ingaged but three; and that their friends had gotten proviſion of Arms and Powder out of <hi>England;</hi> that the Court was extremely corrupted; and that the matters of Church and State were ſo out of frame as muſt tend to a Change.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There were no Witneſſes, and the Defendant denying what the Appellant affirmed, the Tryal was thought muſt be by Duel. In order to which the <hi>King</hi> grants a Commiſſion for a Court-Marſhal: where though the preſumptions of <hi>Ramſey</hi>'s guilt were more heightned, yet the <hi>King</hi> hinders any further proceſs by Combat, which is doubted whether it be lawfull; either thinking none ſo fooliſh as to ſtrive for Empire which He found ſo full of Trouble; or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Magiſtracy being the ſole Gift of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it was vain to commit a crime in hope of enjoying it, or in fear of loſing it:</hi> (which was the Principle upon which Excellent Princes have neglected the diligent Inquiſition of Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) and fatally continues <hi>Hamilton</hi> in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as did enable him afterwards more falſly to act that Treaſon of which he was then accuſed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1632.] Some Tumults in <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104649:25"/>ſhewed a defect in that Government, which made the <hi>King</hi> ſend over as Deputy thither the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> a moſt accompliſhed Perſon in affairs of Rule, of great Abilities equal to a Miniſter of State. The <hi>King</hi>'s choice of him he ſoon ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, by reducing that tumultuary people to ſuch a condition of Peace and ſecurity as it had never been ſince its firſt annexion to this Crown, and made it pay for the Charges of its own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which before was deducted out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſury: their Peace and Laws now opening acceſſes for Plenty.</p>
            <p>This enjoyment of Peace and Plenty through all the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions made Him mindfull of employing ſome fruits of it to the Honour of that God that cauſed it; and not to let ſo great a Proſperity wholly corrupt the minds of men to a neglect of Religion, (which is uſual) He ſhewed His own Zeal for the Ornaments of it, and ſpent part of His Treaſure towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and by His Example, Admonitions and Commands drew many of His Subjects to a Contribution for it; and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it to its primitive luſtre and firmneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned it to a magnificence equall with the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which is ſuppoſed the goodlieſt in the Chriſtian World, had not the Malice of His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forced Him to Arms, mingled His Morter with the blood of innocent people, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly diverted all the Treaſure and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials gathered for this pious deſign, to maintain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104649:25"/>an impious and unjuſt War: and afterwards to diſhonour His Cares for Religion, they barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly made it a Stable for their Horſe, and Quarters for their unhallowed Foot.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1633.] Some Reaſons of State drew the <hi>King</hi> from <hi>London, May</hi> 13. to receive the Imperial Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Himſelf profeſſed that <hi>He had no great Stomach to the Journey, nor delight in the Nation, being a Race of men, that under the Scheme of an honeſt animoſity and ſpecious plain-dealing were moſt perfidious.</hi> A full Character of their great Movers. Yet as He had been nobly treated all along His Journey by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, ſo was He there magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently received and crowned at <hi>Edinburgh, June</hi> 10. But the King ſoon found all thoſe Careſſes falſe. For the Nobility and Laick Patrons could not concoct His <hi>Revocation</hi> (though legal and innocent) of ſuch things as had been ſtoln from the Crown during His Father's Minority, with a Commiſſion for <hi>Surrendry</hi> of <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Tithes</hi> to be retaken from the <hi>King</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occupants (who could as then pretend no other Title than the unjuſt uſurpation of their Anceſtors) on ſuch conditions as might bring ſome Profit to the Crown, (to which they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged) ſome Augmentation to the Clergy, and far more eaſe and benefit to the Common People, whom by advantage of thoſe illegal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures they oppreſſed with a moſt bitter Vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. This Act of His Majeſty being ſo full of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104649:26"/>equity and publick good, thoſe whoſe greatneſs was builded upon Injuſtice did not bare-faced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe it, but endeavoured to hinder that and all the other deſigns of Peace and Order, by oppoſing in the Parliament next after the Coronation the Act of <hi>Ratification</hi> of all thoſe Laws which King <hi>James</hi> had made in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better regulating the affairs of that Church, both as to the Government and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of it.</p>
            <p>This was highly oppoſed by ſuch as were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their diminution by a legal reſtitution of their unrighteous Poſſeſſions. And although the King carried it by the major part of Voices; yet to prevent their own fires with the publick Ruine, they did moſt aſſiduouſly ſlander it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People as the abetting of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the betraying their Spiritual Liberty to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> yoke. Theſe Calumnies received more credit by the King's Order for a more decent and Reverend Worſhip of God at His Royal Chappel at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> conformably to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Uſage.</p>
            <p>Their noiſe grew lowder by the Concent of their party of <hi>Malecontents</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who alſo took advantage to diffuſe their poiſon from the King's Book of Sports, which King <hi>JAMES</hi> had in his time publiſhed in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and was now ratified by <hi>King CHARLES</hi> for a more univerſal Obſervance. The Occaſion of which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104649:26"/>was the Apoſtaſie of many to <hi>Popery,</hi> (whoſe Doctrines and Practices are more indulgent to the licentious) through the rigid opinion of ſome Preachers, who equall'd all Recreations on the Sabbath (as they call'd it) to the moſt prodigious tranſgreſſions. On the contrary, ſome of the ignorant Teachers had perverted many to down-right <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſo ſtrict an Obſervance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. And ſome over-buſie Juſtices of Peace had ſuppreſſed all the Ancient Feaſts of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications</hi> of Churches. The <hi>King</hi> therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this edict to obſtruct the ſucceſs of the Enemies on both ſides, and to free His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the yoke of this Superſtition. But (<hi>ſuch is the weakneſs of Humane Prudence, that the Remedies it applies to one Inconvenience are pregnant of another; and whereas the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men ſeldom do good but as neceſſitated by Law, when Liberty is indulged, all things are ſoon filled with Diſorder and Confuſion.</hi> And ſo) it happened in this, that the Vulgar abuſing the <hi>King</hi>'s Liberty, (which was no more than is granted in other Proteſtant Churches) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many undecencies, made many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd Spirits too capable and credulous of thoſe importunate Calumnies of the Faction, that His Majeſty was not well-affected to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1634.] The boldneſs of the <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi>-Pirates infeſting our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104649:27"/>Coaſts, damaging our Traffique, the uſurpation of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fiſhers on the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominion in the Narrow Seas, and His Right diſputed in a Tract by the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> call the <hi>King</hi>'s next Cares for His own Honour, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Safety. But the Remedy appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding difficult; the furniſhing of a Navy for ſo honourable an undertaking being too heavy a burden for His Exchequer; which (although not emptied by any luxuriant Feaſts, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely waſted on ſome prodigal and unthrifty Favourite, nor laviſhed on ambitious deſigns, from all which deſtructions of Treaſure no King was more free) was but juſt ſufficient for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and neceſſary Expences of State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And though it was moſt juſt for Him to expect the Peoples Contribution to their own Safety, who were never richer than now, nor had they ever more Security for their riches than they now had by His Conceſſions of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: yet knowing how powerfull the Faction alwayes was to diſturb the Counſels of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He feared that from their Proceedings the Common Enemies would be incouraged (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) to higher Inſolencies, and the envious Demagogues would contemn their own ſafety to ruine His Honour. He alſo accounted it a great unhappineſs to be neceſſitated to maintain His State by extraordinary wayes, and therefore refuſed to renew <hi>Privy Seals</hi> and <hi>Loans,</hi> the uſe of which He debarred Himſelf of in granting the Petition of Right. Therefore conſults His At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney-General
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104649:27"/>
               <hi>Noy,</hi> whether the <hi>Prerogative</hi> had yet any thing left to ſave an unwilling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Noy</hi> acquaints Him with <hi>Ancient Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of raiſing a Tax upon the Nation for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth a Navie in caſe of danger,</hi> and aſſures Him of the Legality of the way in proceeding by Writs to that effect. Which Counſel being embraced, there were Writs directed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties for ſuch a Contribution, that in the whole might build, furniſh and maintain 47 Ships for the ſafety of the Kingdom. And by theſe the <hi>King</hi> ſoon ſecured and calmed the Seas; but the Faction endeavoured to raiſe a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt at Land.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1635.] They complained of Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Liberties, becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops endeavoured in theſe years to reduce the Ceremonies of the Church to their primitive Obſervance, of which a long Proſperity had made men negligent: and time had done that to the Spiritual Body which it doth to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, daily amaſſed thoſe Corruptions which at length will ſtand in need of cure. Therefore when they took this proper Method of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a corrupted State in bringing things back to their Original Inſtitution, both His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and they were defamed with deſigns of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tax of Ship-money was pretended a breach to their Civil Liberties, and contrary to Law, becauſe not laid by a Parliament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104649:28"/>thoſe who ſought the People's favour to alter the preſent Government, by ſeeming the ſingular Patrons of their Rights, refuſed to pay the Tax, [<hi>Anno</hi> 1636.] and ſtood it out to a Tryal at Law. The Juſt <hi>Prince</hi> declined not the Tryal, and permitted Monarchy and Liberty to plead at the ſame Bar. All the Judges of the Land did juſtifie by their Subſcriptions, that <hi>it was legal for the King to levy ſuch a Tax;</hi> and their Subſcriptions were enrolled in all the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall. And when it came to be argued in the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Chamber, ten of them abſolutely declared for it; only two, <hi>Crooke</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi> openly diſſented from that opinion to which they had formerly ſubſcribed, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ignominy of Levity unbeſeeming their places. And as the <hi>King</hi> was thus victorious in the Law, ſo was He at Sea; and having curbed the Pirates, He alſo reduced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to a precarious uſe of His Seas.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all theſe Difficulties and Calumnies the <hi>King</hi> hitherto had ſo governed, that ſober men could not pray for, nor Heaven grant in Mercy to a People any greater Happineſs than what His Reign did afford. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire never more flouriſhed with Magnificent Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; the Trade of the Nation had brought the wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> home to our doors; Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all good Sciences were ſo cheriſhed, that they grew to Admiration, and many Arts of the Ancients, buried and forgotten by time, were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104649:28"/>revived again. No Subjects under the Sun rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and (which was the effect of that) none prouder. Security increaſed the Husband-mans ſtock, and Juſtice preſerved his Life; none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned as to Life, but by the lawfull Verdict of thoſe of an equal Condition, the Jury of his Peers. The poor might Reverence, but needed not Fear the Great: and the Great though he might deſpiſe, yet could not injure his more obſcure Neighbour. And all things were ſo adminiſtred, that they ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to the Publick good; except that they made our <hi>Happineſs too much the cauſe of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Commotions,</hi> and brought our Felicity to that height, that by the neceſſity of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath placed all things in motion, it muſt neceſſarily decline. And God provoked by our ſins did no longer reſtrain and obſtruct the arts and fury of ſome wicked men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning their preſent certain enjoyments, hoped for more wicked acquiſitions in publick Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; to overwhelm every part of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions with a deluge of Blood and Miſery, and to commence that War, which as it was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid with much ſlaughter, ſo it was memorable with the Experiences of His Majeſties Vertues; Confuſions, like Winds, from every Coaſt at once aſſaulting and trying His Righteous Soul.</p>
            <p>The firſt Storm aroſe from the North, and the flame firſt broke out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where thoſe Lords who feared they ſhould loſe their ſpoils
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104649:29"/>of Religion and Majeſty, took all occaſions to haſten the publick Miſery (which at laſt moſt heavily lay upon their Country, the hands they had ſtrengthened and inſtructed to fight againſt their Prince, laying a more unſupportable ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon them than their moſt impious Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could form in the imaginations of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous that they might fear from the <hi>King</hi>) by calumniating the <hi>King</hi>'s Government, raiſing fears of Tyranny and Idolatry, forming and ſpreading ſeditious Libels. The Author, or at leaſt the Abettor, of one of which was found to be the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> a Traytor by nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of one who had before merited death for his Treaſons to King <hi>James,</hi> yet found that mercy from him as the Son now did from King <hi>Charles,</hi> to have his Life and Eſtate continued after condemnation. Yet this perfidious man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the <hi>King</hi>'s Clemency for his own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and he that had dared ſuch a Crime, could not be changed by the Pardon of it; and as if he had rather received an Injury than Life, he was the moſt active in the approaching Rebellion.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1637.] For the Rabble, that delights in Tumults, were fitted by this and other Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeus for any occaſion of contemning the <hi>King</hi>'s Authority (though His deſigns, that were thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the Nobleſs, were evidently for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Populacy) and at laſt took fire from the Liturgy, ſomething differing from ours, (leſt a full conſent might argue a dependency upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104649:29"/>Church of <hi>England</hi>) which ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhops had compoſed and preſented to the <hi>King</hi> for the uſe of their Church; which the <hi>King,</hi> who was deſirous that thoſe who were united under His Command might not be divided in Worſhip, confirmed, and appointed to be firſt read <hi>July</hi> 13. at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a City always pregnant with ſuſpicions and falſe rumours. But it was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with all the inſtruments of Fury that were preſent to a debauched multitude: for they flung cudgels and ſticks at the Dean of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> while he was performing his Office; and after that was done, re-inforc'd their aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Biſhops, whom the Earls of <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and <hi>Traquaire</hi> pretended to protect, who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome affronts, that their Patience might provoke a greater rage in the Multitude, which a vigorous puniſhment had eaſily extinguiſh'd. For <hi>they that are fierce in a croud, being ſingled, through their particular fears become obedient. And that rabble that talks high againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of their Prince, when danger from the Laws is within their ken, diſtruſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and return to ſubjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it ſoon appeared that this was not the bare effort of a mutinous Multitude, but a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Conſpiracy; and to this Multitude, whoſe preſent terrour was great, yet would have been contemptible in a ſhort ſpace, there appeared Parties to head them of ſeveral Orders. Who preſently digeſted their Partiſans into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104649:30"/>Tables, and concocted this Mutiny into a formal Rebellion. To proſecute which they mutually obliged themſelves and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a <hi>Covenant</hi> to extirpate <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and whatſoever they pleaſed to brand with the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and to defend each other againſt all Perſons, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reduce this people to more peaceful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, the <hi>King</hi> ſends Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> (one who being careſſed by His Majeſties Favour had riſen to ſuch a degree of wealth and greatneſs, that now he dreamed of nothing leſs than Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to bring his power to perfection, at leaſt to be Monarch of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to which he had ſome pretenſions by his birth) as His Commiſſioner. Who with a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Loyalty diſſembled that pleaſure which he took in the oppoſition of the Covenanters, whoſe firſt motions were ſecretly directed by his counſels, and thoſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, <hi>Traquaire</hi> and <hi>Roxbrough,</hi> for all his Allies were of that party (contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Country, where all the Members of a Family eſpouſe the part of their Head though in the utmoſt danger:) and his Mother rid armed with Piſtols at her Saddle-bow for defence of the Covenant. By his actings there new ſeeds of Diſcontents and War were daily ſown, and his oppoſitions ſo faint, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſed than allayed their fury: By ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral returns to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> for new Inſtructions
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104649:30"/>he gave time to the Rebels to conſolidate their Conſpiracy, to call home their Exiles of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that were in foreign Armies, and provide Arms for open Force: By his falſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſtate of things, he induced the <hi>King</hi> to temporize with the too-potent Corruption of that Nation (an artifice King <hi>JAMES</hi> had ſometimes practiſed) and by granting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to make them ſenſible of the evils which would flow from their own counſels. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi> gave Order for revoking the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> the <hi>High-Commiſſion,</hi> the Book of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and the Five <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Covenanters were more inſolent by theſe Conceſſions, becauſe they had gotten that by unlawful courſes and unjuſt force which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Submiſſion had never obtained; and imputing theſe Grants to the <hi>King</hi>'s Weakneſs, not his Goodneſs, they proceeded to bolder At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: Indicted an Aſſembly without Him, in which they aboliſhed <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all that adhered to them. Afterwards they ſeiſed upon the <hi>King</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, ſurpriſed His Forts and Caſtles, and at laſt put themſelves into Arms.</p>
            <p>Provoked with theſe Injuries the <hi>King</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſes a gallant Army, in which was a very great appearance of Lords and Gentlemen, and with theſe marches, and incamps within two miles of <hi>Berwick,</hi> within ſight of the Enemy.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104649:31"/>But their preſent Condition being ſuch as could endure neither War nor Peace, they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſſipate that Army, which they could not overthrow, by a pretence to a Pacification. For which they petition'd the <hi>King,</hi> who yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it out of His innate tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood. So an Accord was made <hi>June</hi> 17. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1639.] and the <hi>King</hi> disbands His Army, expecting the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould do the like, according to the Articles of Agreement.</p>
            <p>But they being delivered from Fear, would not be reſtrained by Shame from breaking their Faith. For no ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> disbanded, but they proteſted againſt the <hi>Pacification,</hi> printed many falſe Copies of it, that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it diſhonourable to the <hi>King,</hi> retained their Officers in pay, changed the old Form of holding Parliaments, invaded the Prerogatives of the Crown, and ſolicited the <hi>French</hi> King for an aid of men and money.</p>
            <p>This perfidious abuſe of His Majeſty's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency made thoſe that judge of Counſels by the Iſſue to cenſure the King's Facility. <q>Some wondred how He could imagine there would be any Moderation in ſo corrupt a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and that they who had broken the Peace out of a deſire of War, ſhould now lay aſide their Arms out of a love to Quiet. That there would be always the ſame cauſes to the <hi>Scots</hi> of diſturbing <hi>England,</hi> and oppoſing Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104649:31"/>their unquiet nature and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: therefore unleſs ſome ſtrong impreſſion made them either unable or unwilling to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract our quiet, the <hi>King</hi> was to look for a ſpeedy return of their Injuries. Others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the Accord to the <hi>King</hi>'s ſenſe that ſome eminent Officers in His own Camp were pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with Counſels not different from the Covenanters: and that <hi>Hamilton</hi> His Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had betrayed the ſeaſons of fighting by riding quietly in the <hi>Forth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and had ſecret Conference with His Mother, the great Nurſe of the Covenant, on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. But moſt referred it to the <hi>King</hi>'s innate tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood, and to His Prudence not to defile His Glory with the overthrow (which ſeemed probable) of a contemptible Enemy, where the gains of the Victory could not balance the hazards of attempting it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1640.] While men thus diſcourſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> Perfidiouſneſs, the <hi>King</hi> prepares for another Army, and in order thereto calls a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and another in <hi>England,</hi> for aſſiſtances againſt the Rebels in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> granted Money to raiſe and pay 8000 men in Arms, and furniſh them with Ammunition. Yet this Example, with the <hi>King</hi>'s account of the Injuries done to Him and this Nation by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and his promiſe of for ever acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them of Ship-money if now they would
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104649:32"/>freely aſſiſt Him, prevailed nothing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, whom the Faction drew aſide to other Counſels. And when the King ſent Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> to re-mind them of His deſires, and to demand Twelve Subſidies, yet to accept of Six, he induſtriouſly (as was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from His own and His Sons following pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices) inſiſted upon the Twelve, without inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the leſſer quantity His Majeſty would be contented with; which gave ſuch an opportunity and matter for ſeditious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, that the Houſe was ſo exaſperated, as that they were about to Remonſtrate againſt the War with <hi>Scotland.</hi> To prevent this omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous effect of the falſeneſs of His Servant, the <hi>King</hi> was forced to diſſolve the Parliament <hi>May</hi> 5. yet continued the Convocation, which granted Him 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound for all their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Promotions. But the Laiety that in the Houſe had not time to declame againſt His Majeſties Proceedings, did it without doors; for being diſperſed to their homes, they filled all places with ſuſpicious Rumours and high Diſcontents: and in <hi>Southwark</hi> there was an open Mutiny began, which was not pacified without much danger, and the Execution of the principal Leaders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> thus betrayed, defamed and deſerted by thoſe who ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that in His Honour their Safety was embarqued, though He had no leſs cauſe to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104649:32"/>fear ſecret Conſpiracies at Home, which were more dangerous becauſe obſcure, than the <hi>Scots</hi> publick Hoſtility; yet vigorouſly proſecuted His undertaking, and raiſed a ſufficient Army: but could not do it with equal ſpeed to His Enemies, who had ſoon re-united their diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forces; and incouraged by the Faction, with whom they held Intelligence, in <hi>England,</hi> contented not themſelves to ſtand upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but invaded us, and advanced ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the <hi>King</hi>'s Army could be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they gave a defeat to a Party of it ere the Rear could be brought up by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was appointed General, or the <hi>King</hi> could come to encourage them with His Preſence.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner arrived at His Army, but there followed Him from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords a Petition, conformable to the <hi>Scotch Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,</hi> which they called the <hi>Intentions of the Army.</hi> So that His Majeſty might juſtly fear ſome attempts in the South, while He was thus defending Himſelf from the Northern injuries. The <hi>King</hi> anſwered the Petitioners, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Petition came He had reſolved to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all the Peers to conſult what would be moſt for the Safety of the Nation and His own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Who accordingly met, <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. Where it was determined that a Parliament ſhould be called to meet, <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. and in the mean time a Ceſſation ſhould be made with the <hi>Scots,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104649:33"/>with whom ſome Commiſſioners from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould Treat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. began that Fatal Parliament, which was ſo tranſported by the Arts of ſome unquiet perſons, that they diſhonoured the name and hopes of a Parliament, ingulfed the Nation in a Sea of Blood, ruined the <hi>King,</hi> and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their own Priviledges and the People's Liberty into the power of a Phanatick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Army. And although His Majeſty could not hope to find them moderate, yet He endeavoured to make them ſo; telling them at their meeting, that He was reſolved to put Himſelf freely upon the Affections of His <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects; that He would ſatisfie all their juſt Grievances, and not leave to malice it ſelf a ſhadow to doubt of His deſire to make this a glorious and flouriſhing Kingdom. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their care the chaſing out of the Rebels, the Proviſions of His own Army, and the Relief of the oppreſſed Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>But the Malignity of ſome few, and the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorance of more, employed that Aſſembly in other matters: Firſt, In purging their Houſe of all ſuch as they conceived would not comply with their deſtructive enterpriſes; and for ſuch men they either found ſome fault with their Elections, or made them Criminals in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Grievance; though others of a deeper
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104649:33"/>guilt they kept among them, that their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences might make them obnoxious to their power, and obſequious to their commands. Then with compoſed Harangues they declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the publick Grievances, and reckoned up caſual Misfortunes amongſt deſigned Abuſes of Government, every way raiſing up Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies againſt the preſent Power: and that which was fulleſt of Detraction and Envy was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded as moſt pregnant with Liberty. Thus pretending ſeveral Injuries had been done to the People, they raiſed the Multitude to hopes of an unimaginable Liberty, and a diſcontent with the preſent Government. After this they ſet free all the Martyrs of Sedition, that for their malignant Libels had been impriſoned, and three of them were conducted through <hi>London</hi> with ſuch a company of people adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Roſemary and Bays, as it ſeemed a Triumph over Juſtice and thoſe Tribunals that ſentenced them. Then they fell upon all the chief Miniſters of State: they impeached the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> after him the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> Keeper of the Great Seal, the Judges that according to their Oath had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Ship-money legal, and others; ſome of which fled, thoſe that were found were clapt in Priſon: ſo that the <hi>King</hi> was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of thoſe that were able or faithful to give Him Counſel, and others terrified in their Miniſtery to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:104649:34"/>While the Factious thus led the Houſe, their Partiſans without by their Inſtructions formed Petitions againſt the Government in Church and State; to which they ſeduced the ignorant Rabble in the City and ſeveral Counties to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and in a tumultuous manner to preſent them to their Patriots. Who being animated by the ſucceſs of their Arts, fell to draw up a Bill for <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliaments, wherein the Power of calling that great Council of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, upon refuſal of the <hi>King,</hi> and the neglect of others, devolved upon Conſtables. Which profanation of Majeſty though the <hi>King</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them from, yet they perſiſted in; and He paſſed it.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1641.] After five Months time (for ſo long a ſpace they took to rake up Matter and Witneſſes to juſtifie their accuſation, and to give leiſure to the Court for Overtures of gainful Offices to the great Sticklers againſt him; which not appearing) the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is brought to his Trial in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall before the Lords as his Judges: (the <hi>King, Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> ſitting behind a Curtain in an adjoining Gallery) and round about the Court ſtood the Commons. His Accuſers and Witneſſes were <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (and indeed ſo brave a Perſon could not be ruined but by the pretended hatred of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſuch as envied his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104649:34"/>and greatneſs in the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour. The <hi>Scotch,</hi> becauſe they knew his Prudence able to counter-work their Frauds, diſcover their impudent Cheats, and his wiſe management to overthrow their Force. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> hatred aroſe from his juſt and neceſſary Severity in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereby he had reduced them from ſo great a Barbarouſneſs that was impatient of Peace, to a Civility that was fertile of Plenty; and by Artifices, Husbandry and Commerce had rendred that tumultuary Nation ſo rich, that they were now able to repay to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſury thoſe great Debts which their former Troubles and Commotions had contracted. Although thoſe of this Nation were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſworn Enemies both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and State, and were even then practiſing and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating their Rebellion, (which they hoped more eaſie when ſo wiſe a Governour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved) and ſo prone enough of themſelves to the Crime; yet were they much careſſed by the Faction, that theſe in the name of the whole Kingdom ſhould preſs the <hi>Earl</hi> with envy to the Grave.</p>
            <p>His Charge conſiſted of Twenty eight Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (that their number might cover their want of Evidence.) To all which the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (whoſe Patience was not overcome, nor his nature changed by the Reproaches of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers) anſwers with ſo brave a Preſence of Spirit, ſuch firm Reaſons, and ſo clear an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104649:35"/>that he whom the mercenary Tongues of their Lawyers had rendred as a Monſter of men, could not be found guilty of Treaſon, either in the particulars or the whole. So that his Enemies were filled with madneſs that their Charge of Crimes appeared no other than a Libel of Slanders; and the diſ-intereſſed Hearers were (beſides the pleaſure they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find ſo great Endowments polluted with no hainous Crimes) ſenſible of the unhappineſs of thoſe who are <hi>Miniſters of State among a Factious people, where their proſperous Counſels are not rewarded, and unſucceſsful, though pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are ſeverely accuſed: when they err, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one condemns them, and their wiſe Advices few praiſe; for thoſe that are benefited envy, and ſuch as are diſappointed hate thoſe that gave them.</hi> And ſuch ſeemed the Fate of this Excellent Counſellour, whom nothing elſe but his great Parts, his Maſter's Love and Truſt had expoſed to this Danger.</p>
            <p>The Faction being obſtructed this way, by the Earl's Innocency and Abilities, from taking away his Life, move the Houſe to proceed by a Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> to the making a Law after the Fact, whereby they Vote him guilty of High Treaſon: yet add a Caution, that it ſhould not be drawn into a Precedent, ſeeking to ſecure themſelves from a return of that Injuſtice upon themſelves which they acted on him, intending to proſecute what they falſly charged him with,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104649:35"/>the Alteration of Government. Which yet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not without a long debate and contention: for many that had none but honeſt hopes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to adminiſter to the Intereſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the blood of ſo much Innocent Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and thoſe that were prudent ſaw how ſuch an Example opened the avenues to ruine of the beſt Perſons, when once expoſed to publick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Therefore they earneſtly diſſwaded ſuch a proceed. And fifty nine of the moſt eminent openly diſſented when it came to the Vote; whoſe Names were afterwards poſted, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the fury of the Rabble, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they might not oppoſe the deſigns of the Factious, unleſs they deſired to be torn in pieces.</p>
            <p>In two dayes the Lower Houſe paſt the Bill, ſo ſwift were the Demagogues to ſhed blood: but the Lords Houſe was a little more delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (the <hi>King</hi> having amongſt them declared His ſenſe of the Earl's Innocency:) of whoſe ſlow Reſolves the Faction being impatient, there came a ſeditious rabble of about 5 or 6000 of the dregs of the people, armed with Staves and Cudgels, and other Inſtruments of Outrage, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by the more unquiet Members both of the Houſe of Commons and the City) to the Parliament doors, clamouring <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice:</hi> and the next day, to raiſe their Fury, there was a report ſpred among them of ſome endeavours to prepare an Eſcape for the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> therefore with more fierceneſs they raiſed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104649:36"/>their clamours, ſome objecting Treaſon to him, others their Decay of Trade, and each one ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was inſtructed (for ſome of the Houſe of Commons would be among them, to direct their Fury, and to give ſome order to their Tumult, that it might appear more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,) or the ſenſe of his own neceſſities and luſts led him, urged his different motives for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and at laſt, heated by their own motion and noiſe, they guard the doors of the Houſe of Peers, offer inſolencies to the Lords, eſpecially the Biſhops, as they went in, and threaten them if their Votes diſagree from their clamours. And when they had thus made an aſſault on the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Parliament (which yet was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo Sacred) they afterward ſet upon the neighbouring <hi>Abby-Church,</hi> where forcing open the doors they brake down the Organs, ſpoiled all the Veſtments and Ornaments of the Worſhip: from thence they fly to Court, and diſturb the Peace of it with their undecent and barbarous clamours: and at laſt were raiſed to that impudency, as to upbraid the <hi>King,</hi> (who from a Scaffold perſwaded them as they paſſed by to a modeſt care of their own private affairs) with an unfitneſs to reign.</p>
            <p>When ſome Juſtices of the Peace, according to the Law, endeavoured to ſuppreſs thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults by impriſoning the moſt forward and bold Leaders, they themſelves were impriſoned by the Command of the Commons, upon pretext
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104649:36"/>of an injury offered to the Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; of which one was (as they then dictated) <hi>That every one might ſafely petition the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> yet when the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men came to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for ſomething contrary to the Guſt of the Faction, they cauſed the <hi>City</hi> Gates to be ſhut upon them; and when other Counties were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating Addreſſes for Peace, by threatnings they deterred them from ſuch honeſt underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. And when ſome prudent Perſons mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Demagogues how diſhonourable it was for the Parliament not to ſuppreſs ſuch Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they replyed, that <hi>their friends ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be thanked and careſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe and other Arts having wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the freedom of that Council, and many with-drawing themſelves from ſuch Outrages, when ſcarce the third part of the Peers were preſent, the Faction of that Houſe likewiſe paſſed the Bill, the Diſſenters being out-voted only by ſeven Voices. Yet all this could not prevail upon the <hi>King,</hi> though the Tumults were ſtill high without, and within He was daily ſolicited by the Lords of His Palace (who now looked upon the Earl as the Herd doth on an hurt Deer, and they hoped his Blood would be the Luſtration of the Court) to leave the Earl as a Sacrifice to the Vulgar Rage. Nor did the <hi>King</hi> any ways yield, till the Judges (who were now obſequious to the pleaſures of the Parliament) declared He might do it by Law,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104649:37"/>and the Earl by his own Letters devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Victim for the publick Peace and His Majeſties Safety: and then overcome with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities on all hands, and being abuſed by bad dealing of the Judges (as Himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Biſhops whom He conſulted in that Caſe, and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who was one of them, anſwered, <hi>That if the</hi> King <hi>in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience found him not guilty, He ought not to paſs the Bill; but for matter of Law, what was Treaſon, he referred Him to the Judges, who, according to their Oath, ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferently betwixt Him and His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi>) The other four Biſhops that were then conſulted, <hi>Durham, Lincoln, Carliſle,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> were not ſo free as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was, and therefore the King obſerved a ſpecial bleſſing of God upon him. He at laſt with much reluctancy ſigned a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſome Lords to paſs that Bill of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder,</hi> and another for <hi>Continuation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament during the pleaſure of the Two Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The paſſing of theſe two Bills, as ſome thought, wounded the <hi>King</hi>'s Greatneſs more than any thing He ever did. The firſt, becauſe it cut off a moſt exquiſite Inſtrument of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and a moſt faithful Servant: and none did more make uſe of this to pollute His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than thoſe who had even forced Him to it; like thoſe malignant and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits who upbraid unhappy Souls with thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104649:37"/>Crimes and ruines to which they themſelves have tempted and betrayed them. But the heavieſt Cenſor was Himſelf, for He never left bewailing His Compliance, or rather Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, with this Murder, till the iſſue of His Blood dried up thoſe of His Tears.</p>
               <p>By the other Bill He had, as ſome cenſured, renounced His Crown, and granted it to thoſe men who at preſent exerciſed ſo Arbitrary a Power, that they wanted nothing but length of time to be reputed Kings, and this they now had gotten. But the more Speculative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it an act of eſpecial Prudence, for the <hi>King</hi> made that an evidence of His ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to oblige His people, and overcome the Malice of His Enemies with Benefits: which the Faction would have uſurped, and by the boldneſs of the attempt ingaged the People to them as the only Patrons of their Liberty. And they were furniſhed with an Example for it by their Confederates in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who indicted an Aſſembly without the <hi>King</hi>'s leave, and continued it againſt His plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and (as <hi>all imitations of Crimes exceed their first pattern</hi>) it was conceived theſe men whoſe furies were more unjuſt, and ſo would be more fierce, intended to improve that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the extremeſt guilt.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Bill was no ſooner ſigned, but they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened the Execution; and ſo much the more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104649:38"/>eagerly, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> deſired, in a moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Letter delivered by the <hi>Prince</hi> to the Lords, that that Excellent Soul which found ſo much Injuſtice on Earth, might have the more time to fit it ſelf for the Mercy of Heaven. But this favour which became Chriſtians to grant, agreed not with the Religion of his Adverſaries, and therefore the ſecond day after he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> (in his Paſſage thither he had a ſight of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whoſe Prayers and Bleſſing he with a low Obeiſance begged, and the moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prelate beſtowed them with Tears,) where with a greater preſence of mind than he had looked his Enemies in the face did he encounter Death, and ſubmitted his neck to the ſtroke of the Executioner. <q>He was a perſon of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit, fitted for the nobleſt enterpriſes, and the moſt difficult parts of Empire. His Counſels were bold, yet juſt, and he had a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour proper for the Execution of them. Of an Eloquence, next to that of His Maſter's, maſculine, and moſt excellent. He was no leſs affectionate to the Church than to the State, and not contented while living to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Government and Patrimony of it, he commended it alſo to his Son when he was about to die, and charged his abhorrency of Sacrilege. His Enemies called the Majeſty of his Miene in his Lieutenancy, Pride, and the undaunted execution of his Office on the contumacious, the Inſolency of his fortune.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104649:38"/>He was cenſured for committing that fatal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of following the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>London</hi> and to the Parliament after the Pacification with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>York;</hi> and it was thought, that if he had gone over to his charge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have ſecured both himſelf and that Kingdom for His Majeſties Service. But ſome attributed this Counſel to a neceſſity of <hi>Fate, whoſe firſt ſtroke is at the brain of thoſe whom it deſigns to ruine,</hi> and brought him to feel the effects of Popular Rage, which himſelf in former Parliaments had uſed againſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to find the Experience of his own advices againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence teaching us to abhor over-fine Counſels by the miſchiefs they bring upon their Authors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Fall of this Great Man ſo terrified the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers of State, that the Lord <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi> reſigned his Staff to the Hands from whence he received it; the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> forſook the Maſterſhip of the Court of <hi>Wards;</hi> and the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the Prince returned Him to the <hi>King:</hi> Theſe Lords parting with their Offices, like thoſe that ſcatter their Treaſure and Jewels in the way, that they might delude the violence of their greedy purſuers.

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104649:39"/>When the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was dead, then did the Parliament begin to think of ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Scots,</hi> who hitherto had much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed the Northern Counties, and increaſed the charges of the Nation: but now they were Voted to receive 300000 pound, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Brotherly Aſſiſtance, but in truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Faction, as a reward for their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours for the <hi>Earls</hi> Blood; yet were they kept ſo long till the <hi>King</hi> had paſſed away more of His Prerogative, in ſigning the Bills to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> After which ſpoils of Majeſty they disband the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Armies, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. and on the 10. of that Month the <hi>King</hi> follows them into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle, if it were poſſible, that Kingdom. But the <hi>King</hi> ſtill found them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: when He ſatisfied their greedy appetites, then would they offer Him their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but when gain or advantage appeared from His Enemies, they appeared in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature ungrateful, changeable and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whom no favours could oblige, nor any thing but Ruine was to be expected by building upon their Love.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> was in <hi>Scotland</hi> labouring to ſettle that Nation by granting all that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Ambition of their Leaders pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was for the Publick good, and ſo aimed at no leſs than a Miracle, by His Benefits to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104649:39"/>
               <hi>Faith</hi> (which, <hi>like Life, when it is once departed doth never naturally return</hi>) into thoſe perfidious breaſts; the Parliament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journs, and leaves a ſtanding <hi>Committee</hi> of ſuch as were the Leaders or the Servants of the Faction. Theſe prepared new Toils for His Majeſties Return, and by them was the <hi>Grand Remonſtrance</hi> formed: in it were reckoned for Grievances all the Complaints of men that were impatient of Laws and Government; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of Courtiers, the unpleaſing Reſolves of Judges, the Neglects or Rigours of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Juſtice, the undigeſted Sermons of ſome Preachers, yea, the Poſitions of ſome Divines in the Schools, were all exaggerated to defame the preſent Government both in Church and State, and to magnifie the skill of theſe State-Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians that offered Preſcripts for all theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. Beſides, more eaſily to abuſe the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who reckon Misfortunes as Crimes,</hi> unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing accidents were repreſented as deſigns of Tyranny; and thoſe things which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, were yet mentioned as continued bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. From which the people were aſſured there could be no deliverance but by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and magnanimity of the Remonſtrants.</p>
            <p>To prepare the way for this, the moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious parts of it were firſt whiſpered among the Populacy, that by this ſeeming ſuppreſſion men impatient of Secrets might more eagerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge them, and the danger appear greater by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104649:40"/>an affected ſilence. Then prodigious Calumnies (which none but ſouls prone to any wickedneſs could believe of ſo Great a man) were formed of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch ſuſpicions raiſed of Him and His Friends, as might force them to ſome Injuries which hitherto they forbore, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing themſelves increaſe the Publick fears. For <hi>Slanders do rather provoke moſt men than amend them; and the provoked think more of their ſafety, than to adjuſt their actions againſt their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Slanderers.</hi> And when the minds of men were made thus ſolicitous concerning Dangers from the <hi>King,</hi> to make them more pliable and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile, there was repreſented to them an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anger of Heaven againſt the preſent ſtate of things both in Church and State, teſtified by many Prodigies that were related, and porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Preſages of Ruine. Certain Prophecies (for a credulity to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vulgar are infamous) from unknown Oracles are divulged, which enigmatically deſcribe the <hi>King</hi> as a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and from ſuch a Prince muſt proceed a change of Government. Some vain perſons alſo, that gave themſelves up to the Impoſture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, were hired to terrifie the people with the unſignificant Conjunctions of Stars, and from them to foretell ruines to the better part of the World, and an imminent deſtruction on men of the Long Robe, and Alterations of States.</p>
            <p>Theſe were done to temper the minds of men by a ſuperſtition for a guidance of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104649:40"/>who being conceived to be the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Heaven, were ſuppoſed to have it in their Commiſſion, to declare the Conditions of War and Peace: and theſe, either through the ſame weakneſs capable of the like terrors with the Vulgar, or (which is more to be abhorred) corrupted, as ſome were, by the Careſſes and gainful hopes that the Faction baited them with, did juſtifie their fears, and increaſe them by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſome obſcure Prophecies in Scripture to the preſent Times and People; compared the pretended Corruptions of our Church with the Idolatries of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whatſoever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Holy Records, was parallel'd with the things they diſliked here, and all the Curſes that God poured upon His irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obdurate enemies, were denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as differ'd from them, or would not joyn with the Faction.</p>
            <p>To make theſe Harangues more efficacious, the Authors of them received the Reverence of the Demagogues, who (deſpiſing, queſtioning and expoſing to Affronts ſuch ſober Divines as would have cured the madneſs of the People,) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to ſuch Teachers the Titles of Saints, Faithful Miniſters, Pretious men; and they on the other ſide made a return of Epithets to their Maſters, of the Servants of the Moſt High, ſuch as were to do the Work of the Lord; That by their Counſels men were to expect new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and a new Earth; that they were men that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104649:41"/>ſhould prepare the Kingdom for Jeſus Chriſt, and lay the Foundations of the Empire of the Saints which was to laſt a Thouſand years. To make the Cry yet louder, they permitted all Sects and Hereſies a Licence of publick profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (which hitherto Diſcipline, the Care of the Common Peace and Religion had confined to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners) and permitted the Office of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every bold and ignorant undertaker; ſo that at laſt the dregs of the People uſurped that Dignity, and Women, who had parted with the natural modeſty of their Sex, would not only ſpeak, but alſo rule in the Church. All theſe, in gratitude for their Licentiouſneſs, ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to their hearers the admiration of the Authors of it, and bitterly inveighed againſt thoſe whom the Care both of the Souls and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of men would excite to repreſs them, in many of their Raptures denouncing Wo and Judgement to the lawful Governours in Church and State.</p>
            <p>While all theſe Methods of Ruine were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring here, the ſame anger of God, the ſame madneſs of men raiſed up another Tempeſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords and Prieſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who were the prime compoſers of the Tragedies there,) were incouraged by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>Scots, who by a proſperous Rebellion</hi> (as the Hiſtorian of thoſe Troubles writes) <hi>had procured for themſelves ſuch large Privileges,</hi> to an imitation, which the preſent Jealouſies in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104649:41"/>
               <hi>England</hi> (where mutual Contraſts would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their force upon one another,) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſecure. And they had an happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the Vacancy in Government through the ſlaughter of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords (while they proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him in <hi>England</hi>) had removed all thoſe other inferiour Magiſtrates that were moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the affairs of that Kingdom, by accuſing to the Faction ſome of them of Treaſon, and others of an inclination to the <hi>Earl,</hi> and had got preferred to their charges ſuch as were either altogether unacquainted with the <hi>Genius</hi> of that People, or favourers of the Conſpiracy. A ſtrength they had alſo ready; for thoſe 8000 which had been liſted for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were unſeaſonably disbanded, and the <hi>King</hi> in foreſight they might cauſe ſome miſchief in their own Country, had therefore promiſed 4000 of them to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> yet would not the Parliament conſent to their departure, becauſe (as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords ſuggeſted) it would diſpleaſe the King of <hi>France;</hi> and when the <hi>King</hi> promiſed to ſend as many to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, that likewiſe was not reliſhed. The Common Souldiers of that Army being thus made uſeleſs, and therefore like men of their employment moſt fierce when they were to be diſmiſſed from the dangers of War, were eaſily drawn into the Rebellion, although very few of their Officers were polluted with the Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104649:42"/>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords and Prieſts being allured by theſe our Vices and theſe ſeveral opportunities, began their Rebellion <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> throughout that whole Kingdom on a ſudden invading the unprovided <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among them, deſpoiling them of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Goods, and many thouſands of their Lives, without any reſpect of Sex, Age, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or Friendſhip, and made them as ſo many Sacrifices to their bloody Superſtition. They miſſed but a little to have ſurpriſed <hi>Dublin.</hi> But their Conſpiracy being detected there and in ſome few other places, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was preſerved in that Kingdom, till they could receive Succours from hence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had the firſt intelligence of it, in its very beginnings, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereupon ſent Sir <hi>James Stuart</hi> to the Lords of the Privy Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to acquaint them with His Knowledge, and Inſtructions, and to carry all that Money that His preſent Stores could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Beſides, He moves the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as being neareſt, to a ſpeedy help; who decline their Aids, becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> was depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> At the ſame time alſo He ſends poſt to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> who leſs regard it, the Faction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding their fortune, that new Troubles were ariſen to moleſt the <hi>King,</hi> and that the Royal Power being thus aſſaulted in all three Nations,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104649:42"/>there muſt ſhortly ariſe ſo many new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Beſides that it yielded freſh matter of reproach to His Majeſty, to whoſe Counſels at firſt ſecretly they whiſpered, and at laſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly imputed that horrid Maſſacre. Which Slanders were coloured by the Arts of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, who, to diſhearten the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from any reſiſtance, bragged <hi>that the Queen was with their Army; That the King would come amongſt them with Auxiliary Forces; That they did but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain His Cauſe againſt the Puritans; That they had the Kings Commiſſion for what they did,</hi> ſhewing indeed a Patent that themſelves had drawn, but thereto was affixed an Old broad Seal that had been taken from an obſolete Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent out of <hi>Farnham</hi> Abby, by one <hi>Plunckett,</hi> in the preſence of many of their Lords and Prieſts, as was afterwards atteſted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of many. <hi>That the Scots were in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with them,</hi> to beget a faith of which, they abſtained from the lives and fortunes of thoſe of that Nation among them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, to encourage the Natives of their own party, they produce fictitious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein they were informed from <hi>England</hi> that <hi>the Parliament had paſſed an Act, that all the Iriſh ſhould be compelled to the Proteſtant Worſhip; that for the firſt offence they ſhould forfeit all their Goods, for the ſecond their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and for the third their Lives.</hi> Beſides, they preſent them with the hopes of Liberty:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104649:43"/>
               <hi>That the Engliſh Yoke ſhould be ſhaken off; that they would have a King of their own Nation; and that the Goods and Eſtates of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould be divided among the Natives.</hi> And with theſe hopes of Spoil and Liberty the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were driven to ſuch a Fury, that they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many horrid and barbarous acts as ſcarce ever any Age or People were guilty of.</p>
            <p>In the mean while nothing was done for the relief of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, but only ſome Votes paſſed againſt the Rebels, till the <hi>King</hi> returned to <hi>London,</hi> which was about the end of <hi>November:</hi> where He with the Queen and the Prince were magnificently feaſted by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and the Chief of them afterwards by Him at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court. For he never neglected any honeſt Arts to gain His Peoples love; to which they were naturally prone enough, had not His Enemies methods and impulſes depraved their <hi>Genius.</hi> But this much troubled the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who envied that Reverence to Majeſty in others which was not in themſelves, and they endeavoured to make theſe loves ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; for they diſcountenanced the prime ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers of this Honour to the <hi>King,</hi> and were more eager to render Him odious. For having gotten a Guard about them, they likewiſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into the people dangerous apprehenſions as the cauſe of that Guard, and every day grew more nice, and jealous of their Priviledges, and Power. The <hi>King</hi>'s advices to more tenderneſs
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104649:43"/>of His Prerogative, or His Advertiſements of the ſcandalous Speeches that were uttered in their Houſe, they interpret as encroachments upon their Grandeur, and upbraided the <hi>King</hi> for them in their Petitions to Him.</p>
            <p>But their greateſt effort upon Majeſty was the Remonſtrance; after which they took all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to magnifie the apprehenſions of thoſe Fears which they had falſly pretended to in it. This the Faction had before formed, and now brought into the Houſe of Commons; where it found a ſtrong oppoſition by thoſe wiſe men that were tender of the publick Peace and Common Good: though thoſe who preferred their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to the General Intereſt, and every one that was ſhort-ſighted and improvident for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were ſo fierce for it, that the Debates were continued all night till ten a clock the next morning, ſo that many of the more aged, and perſons of beſt fortunes (not accuſtomed to ſuch watchings) were wearied out, and many others, not daring to provoke the Faction in this their grand Deſign, left the Houſe; ſo that at laſt they carried it, yet but by eleven Votes. Which they preſented with a Petition to take away the Votes of Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and the Ceremonies in the Church, and to remove thoſe Perſons from His Truſt which they could not confide in; yet named none, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed all under the name of a <hi>Malignant Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Party. Which they had no ſooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104649:44"/>than they cauſed it to be publiſhed in Print.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>King</hi> anſwers in another pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration, but ſo much to the diſcontent of the Demagogues, to find their Methods of Ruine ſo fully diſcovered as they were in His Majeſties Anſwer, that they had recourſe to their former ſovereign Remedy, which ſober men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a crime, and an indignity to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Tumults of the Rabble. Who in great numbers and much confuſion came up to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſome crying out againſt Biſhops, others belching their fury againſt the Liturgy, and a third party roaring that the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be taken out of the <hi>King</hi>'s hands. To their Clamours they added rude Affronts to thoſe Lords whom their Leaders had taught them to hate, and eſpecially to the Biſhops, at their going in or coming out of the Houſe: and afterwards drawing up to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo inſolent, as it was evident they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only ſome to begin, for there were enough to proſecute an Aſſault upon the <hi>King</hi> in His own Palace.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops thus rudely excluded from their Right and Liberty of coming to the Parliament, Twelve of them afterwards proteſt againſt the Proceedings of it, during their ſo violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Which Proteſtation the Commons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accuſed of High Treaſon, and cauſed their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104649:44"/>Commitment to the <hi>Tower;</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued them till the Bill againſt their Votes in the Lords Houſe was paſt, that they might not produce their Reaſons for their Rights, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Injuſtice offered unto them, and then afterwards releaſed them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> alſo ſaw it neceſſary to take a Guard of ſuch Gentlemen as offered their Service for His Safety, and to prevent the prophaning of Majeſty by the rude fury of the People, who uſed to make their Addreſſes acceptable at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> by offering in their paſſage ſome baſe Affronts at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> But when the terrour of this Guard had reduced them to ſome leſs degree of Impudency, they then, inſtructed by their Heads, laboured to make it more unſafe to the <hi>King,</hi> by ſeeking to raiſe the Rage and Jealouſie of the whole City againſt Him. For at midnight there were cries out in the Street, that all People ſhould ariſe to their defence; for the <hi>King</hi> with His <hi>Papiſts</hi> were coming to fire the City, and cut their throats in their beds. Than which though nothing was more falſe, yet it found the effects of truth; and the People by ſuch Alarms being terrified from ſleep, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thoſe nightly fears lay long upon their Spirits in the day, and filled them almoſt with Madneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> therefore, not alwaies to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage theſe Violences with Patience, but at laſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104649:45"/>by a courſe of Juſtice to take off thoſe whom He had found to be the Authors of theſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Counſels, the grand Movers of theſe Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious practices, and, which was more, the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Foreign Force, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, into this Nation; commands His Atturney General to accuſe Five Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and one of the Lords, upon Articles of High Treaſon, to be tried according to the Laws of the Land: and He alſo ſends ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers to ſeal up their Trunks and Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in their ſeveral Lodgings, and to ſecure their Perſons. This being related to the Houſe of Commons (wherein the Faction was now grown more powerful, and with whom did joyn many men of Integrity in this Occurrence, being too careful of the Priviledges of their Houſe, which yet ſecure none of the Members againſt Juſtice for Murder, Felony, or Treaſon) they were ſo far from admitting the <hi>King</hi>'s Charge againſt them, that they accuſed the <hi>King</hi> of breach of Priviledge, and Vote all thoſe guilty of Enmity to the Common-wealth that ſhall obey the <hi>King</hi> in any of His Commands concerning them.</p>
            <p>This Obſtruction of Juſtice ſo far moved the <hi>King,</hi> together with the Advice of ſome of His Council that were alſo of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as alſo an hope of rooting up the Faction this way, that none through the hope of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment ſhould be incouraged to conſpire the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104649:45"/>publick Ruine, that He Himſelf, with about an hundred Lords and Gentlemen and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, went to the Houſe of Commons: Where commanding His Attendants to move no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Stairs, to offer no violence, nor return any uncivil language to any although pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, Himſelf with the <hi>Paltzgrave</hi> only enters the Houſe, and demands that the Incendiaries might be delivered into His hands, with whom He promiſes to deal no otherwiſe than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law. But they whom he ſought, being before informed (as it is reported) of the <hi>King</hi>'s coming by the ſecret Intelligence of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and a Court Lady (who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt the Confluence of Servants with her Beauty, ſought now to prevent a ſolitude by politick miniſteries) had forſook the place, and withdrawn themſelves into the Sanctuary of the <hi>City.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>King</hi> having renewed His Charge, without injury to any immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts.</p>
            <p>But the Faction would not let Him ſo reſt, but proſecuted this attempt of His with all the Clamours that they poſſibly could raiſe, ſpread the ſparks of Diſſention far and wide, make the common people mad with Fears and Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtir up ſome in ſeveral Counties to bring Petitions for the impeached Members and their Violated Priviledges; and at laſt prepare an armed Rabble diſpoſed into Order to bring the accuſed Demagogues to the Houſe from their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104649:46"/>Coverts in <hi>London.</hi> This coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>King,</hi> although many Gallant and faithful Perſons proffered their Service by min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with the Rout, or by being as Spectators, to curb any Inſolencies that ſhould be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Him; yet was He reſolved to withdraw Himſelf with the Queen and their Children to <hi>Windſor,</hi> that He might permit their Fury to languiſh when it had no oppoſition, and to give time for their jealouſies and rumours to wax old and periſh. For <hi>the firſt Indignation of a mutinous Multitude is moſt fierce, and a ſmall delay breaks their conſent:</hi> and <hi>Majeſty would have a greater Reverence, if any, at a diſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Wiſdom was perceived by His Enemies, and therefore to counterwork it, and not to let the people ſleep without fear, leſt they ſhould come to be ſober, and return to the love of Obedience, ſtrange reports were every day brought of dangers from the <hi>King:</hi> That troops of Papiſts were gathered about <hi>Kingston</hi> upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> where the County Magazine was lodged, under the Command of the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> who was then famed to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> (though at that time he was an elegant Aſſertor of the Proteſtant Faith,) and Col. <hi>Lunsford,</hi> who was characteriſed to be of ſo monſtrous an appetite that <hi>he would eat Children.</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſent to take them both, which found no ſuch dreadful Preparations. At other times, when the People on the Lord's dayes were at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104649:46"/>Divine Worſhip, they were diſtracted from it by Alarms, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who and from whence none could tell) were up in Arms, and were juſt then about to fire their Houſes, and mix their Blood with their Prayers: That there were Forces kept in Grotts and Caves under ground, that ſhould in the night break out into the midſt of the City, and cut all their throats: And what was more prodigious, and though ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, yet had not a few believers in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> That there were deſigns by Gunpowder to blow up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and choak them with the water in their beds. Thus were the people taught to hate their Prince, and by bloody news from every Quarter they were inſtructed to that Cruelty which they vainly feared, and to adore thoſe by whoſe Counſels they were delivered from ſo unexpected Dangers.</p>
            <p>By all this the Faction gained the repute of Modeſty inferiour to their ſuppoſed Truſt, when they demanded nothing elſe but the Command of the Tower, and the <hi>Militia</hi> of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> together with the Forts and Caſtles of the ſame. For all which they moved the Houſe of Commons of petition: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Conjuncture of the Lords in the ſame, were wholly refuſed by them. Therefore ſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Faction they petition alone. Which unlimited Power the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely refuſed to grant unto them, who He foreſaw would uſe that, as they had all His other Conceſſions, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104649:47"/>the ruine of the Author of their Power. Yet was pleaſed to conſent, after He had demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the prejudice they required to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that they might ſend over an Army of 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and deliver unto them the ſtrong Town and Port of <hi>Carick fergus,</hi> one of the Chief Keys of that Kingdom: which was done to oblige the <hi>Scots</hi> to them in their future deſigns. And alſo He was pleaſed to wave the Proſecution of the Impeached Members, and was willing to grant a Free and General Pardon for all His Subjects, as the Parliament ſhould think convenient.</p>
            <p>But all this could not content them who had immoderate deſires, and they were more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that they could not uſurp the <hi>King</hi>'s Rights, than if they had loſt their own Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: therefore to bring the Lords to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with them, the hitherto proſperous Art of Tumultuous Petitions was again practiſed, and great Numbers from ſeveral Counties were moved to come as Earthquakes, to ſhake the Fundamental Conſtitutions of their Houſe, and to require that neither the Biſhops nor the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Lords ſhould continue in their Ancient Right to Vote among the Peers. By this means they ſhould weaken the <hi>King</hi> in the Voices of that Houſe, and whoſoever they could not confide in, they could fright him from Voting againſt them, by expoſing him as Popiſh to the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fury. For this was the mothod of uſing the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104649:47"/>Petitions. The moſt common Anſwer was with Thanks, and that <hi>the Houſe of</hi> Commons <hi>were juſt now in conſideration thereof.</hi> The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were taught to reply, that <hi>They doubted not of the care of the</hi> Commons <hi>Houſe, but all their diſtruſt was in the Houſe of</hi> Lords, <hi>where the Popiſh Lords and Biſhops had the greatest Power, and there it ſtuck, whoſe names they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know:</hi> and in this they were ſo earneſt, that they would not willingly withdraw whileſt it was debated, and then they had leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with this Anſwer, <hi>That the Houſe of</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>had already endeavoured Relief from the</hi> Lords <hi>in their Requeſts, and ſhall ſo continue till Redreſs be obtained.</hi> Such Petitions as theſe were likewiſe from the ſeveral Claſſes of the inferiour Tradeſmen about <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Porters, Water-men,</hi> and the like: and that nothing of teſtifying an univerſal Importunity might be left unattempted, <hi>Women</hi> were perſwaded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Petitions to the ſame effect. While the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thus boaſted in the ſucceſs of their Arts, Good men grieved to ſee theſe daily Infamies of the ſupreme Council of the Nation, all whoſe Secrets were publiſhed to the loweſt and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the People: and they who cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured it as a breach of their Priviledge, that the <hi>King</hi> took notice of their Debates, now made them the Subjects of Diſcourſe in every Shop, and all the corners of the Street; where the good and bad were equally cenſured, and the Honour and Life of every Senator expoſed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104649:48"/>to the Verdict of the Rabble. No Magiſtrate did dare to do his Office, and all things tended to a manifeſt Confuſion: So that many ſober Perſons did leave <hi>the Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>unſaſe, where Factions were more powerful than the Laws. And Juſt Perſons choſe rather to hear than to ſee the Miſeries and Reproaches of their Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, to make the <hi>King</hi> more plyable, they tempt Him by danger in His moſt beloved Part, the <hi>Queen,</hi> concerning whom they cauſed a Rumour, that <hi>they did intend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach Her of High Treaſon.</hi> This Rumour made the deeper Impreſſion, becauſe they had raiſed moſt prodigious Slanders (which are the firſt Marks for deſtruction of Princes) on Her; and when they had removed all other Counſellors from the <hi>King,</hi> She was famed to be the Rock upon which all hopes of Peace and Safety were ſplit: That She commanded no leſs His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels than Affections, and that His Weakneſs was ſo great, as not to conſent to or enterprize any thing which She did not firſt approve: That She had perverted Him to Her Religion, and formed deſigns of overthrowing the Proteſtant Profeſſion. Theſe and many other of a porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous falſhood were ſcattered among the <hi>Vulgar, who are alwayes moſt prone to believe the Worſt of Great Perſons: and the uncontrolled Licence of reporting ſuch Calumnies is conceived the firſt Dawning of Liberty.</hi> But the Parliament taking notice of the Report, ſent ſome of their Houſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104649:48"/>to purge themſelves from it, as <hi>an unjuſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal caſt upon them.</hi> To which the <hi>Queen</hi> mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers, <hi>That there was a general Report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but She never ſaw any Articles in writing, and having no certain Author for either, She gave little credit thereto; nor will She believe they would lay any Aſperſion upon Her, who hath been very unapt to miſconſtrue the actions of any One perſon, and much more the Proceedings of Parliament, and ſhall at all times wiſh an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding between the King and His People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> knowing how uſual it was for the Faction by Tumults and other Practices to tranſport the Parliament from their Juſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in other things, and that they might do ſo in this, reſolved to ſend Her into <hi>Holland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of accompanying their Eldeſt <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> newly married to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but in truth to ſecure Her, ſo that by the fears of Her danger (who was ſo dear unto Him) He might not be forced to any thing contrary to His Honour and Conſcience, and that Her Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Relation to Him might not betray Her Life to the Malice of His Enemies. With Her He alſo ſent all the Jewels of the Crown, that they might not be the ſpoils of the Faction, but the means of the ſupport of Her Dignity in foreign parts, if His Neceſſities afterwards ſhould not permit Him to provide for Her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Which yet She did not ſo employ, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104649:49"/>reſerved them for a ſupply of Ammunition and Arms, when His Adverſaries had forced Him to a neceſſary Defence. It was ſaid that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction knew of this conveyance, and might have prevented it, but that they thought it for their greater advantage that this Treaſure ſhould be ſo managed, that the <hi>King</hi> in confidence of that aſſiſtance might take up Arms, to which they were reſolved at laſt to drive Him. For they thought their Cauſe would be better in War than Peace, becauſe their preſent Deliberations were in the ſenſe of the Law actual Rebellions; and a longer time would diſcover thoſe Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures by which they had deluded the People, who would ſoon leave them (as many now did begin to repent of their Madneſs) to the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which was due to their practices, unleſs they were more firmly united by a communion of guilt in an open aſſaulting their Lawfull Prince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> haſtens the ſecurity of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and accompanies Her as far as <hi>Dover,</hi> there to take his farewell of Her; a buſineſs almoſt as irkſome as death, to be ſeparated from a Wife of ſo great Affections and eminent Endowments: and that which made it the more bitter was, that the ſame cauſe which forced Her Separation from Him ſet Her at a greater diſtance from His Religion, (the only thing wherein their Souls were not united) even the Barbarity of His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who profeſſed it, yet were ſo irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104649:49"/>to Vertue, that they hated Her for Her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Love and Loyalty to Him. While He was committing Her to the mercy of the Winds and Waves, that She might eſcape the Cruelty of more unquiet and faithleſs men, they proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Him with their diſtaſteful Addreſſes, and at <hi>Canterbury</hi> preſent Him with a Bill for taking away Biſhops Votes in Parliament. Which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been caſt out of the Houſe of Peers ſeveral times before, ought not by the Courſe and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Parliament to have been admitted again the ſame Seſſion. But the Faction had now uſed their accuſtomed Engine, a Tumult, and it was then paſſed by the Lords, and brought hither together with ſome obſcure Threats, that if it were not ſigned, the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould not be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart. (By ſuch impious Violences did they make way for that which they call'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>) This His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſigns, (though after it made a part of His penitential Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to God) in hopes that that Bill being once conſented to, the Fury of the Faction, which with ſo great Violence purſued an abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Eccleſiaſtical Government, would be abated, as having advanced ſo far in their deſign to weaken the <hi>King</hi>'s Power in that Houſe by the loſs of ſo many Voices, which would have been alwayes on that ſide where Equity and Conſcience did moſt appear. But He ſoon found the Demagogues had not ſo much Ingenuity as to be compounded with, and they made this but a ſtep to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104649:50"/>of that which He deſigned to preſerve.</p>
            <p>When His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was come back as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> He met with many informations how averſe the Faction was to Peace, and that their Proceedings were raiſed to a level with their Principles, which ſome of them publiſhed, <hi>That the Alteration they did intend, and which was neceſſary both in Church and State, muſt be made by Blood.</hi> Therefore they endeavoured by their Calumnies to create an Hatred of Him, and to deſpoil Him of all the hopefull Effects of His Condeſcenſions. For <hi>when a Prince is once ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his Benefits do him no leſs hurt than Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> In order to this, Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> had publickly charged Him with a Connivence at leaſt, if not with the Contrivance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion: becauſe many Papiſts had His <hi>Majeſties</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Warrant for their tranſport thither. This the <hi>King</hi> requires ſatisfaction for, ſhewing the Falſhood and Malice of the Defamer, by giving an Account of the date of the ſeveral Warrants. But the Faction ſo far prevailed as to make it a Publick Sin, and the Houſe was perſwaded to believe and acknowledge it to be their common ſenſe. Many others had uttered ſeditious Speeches in the Houſe, eſpecially Maſter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> a man of all Uncleanneſſes, a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of Religion and Honeſty, that had waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large Patrimony (which he had likewiſe unjuſtly morgaged to ſeveral and different Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) in the moſt infamous Luſts, and ſought
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104649:50"/>a greater licence and freſh ſupplies for them by the ruine of the State; at which he was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being of as impure and laſcivious a Wit as he was of Life, wherewith he uſed to prophane God and His Vicegerents: yet ſerving the ends of Confuſion, had his name among the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe that were to do the <hi>Work of the Lord.</hi> Beſides the attempts upon His Honour, they endeavour another upon His Family, and to ſeize upon the <hi>Prince.</hi> Which the <hi>King</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſends for Him and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and immediately removes to <hi>Theobalds</hi> in order to His journey towards the North, where He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended to ſettle His abode, till He ſaw what Iſſue this Storm would have.</p>
            <p>This removal of the <hi>King</hi> was variouſly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. <q>Some thought it unadviſedly done, to withdraw ſo far from <hi>London,</hi> to leave His chief City wholly to the practices, and expoſe His Friends there to the Impoſtures and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of His Enemies. Others, eſpecially the Friends of the Faction, defamed it as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Himſelf for that War which followed. But others concluded it as an act of Neceſſity, and where there was no choice for Prudence. For when He had paſſed more obliging Acts, and parted with ſo much of His Prerogative and ſo many undoubted Rights of His Crown, as could not be equalled by the Grants of all His Predeceſſors, yet He found that He had effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more by giving, than to make the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104649:51"/>Faction more eagerly deſire what they knew He muſt in Honour and Conſcience deny; and that the People were ſo bewitched as not to ſee, <hi>it is ſafer to trust Him who was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a leſs degree of Power, than thoſe whoſe ambition and avarice knew no bounds:</hi> Who being thus deluded as ſo far to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Luſts of their Diſturbers, would not fail their aſſiſtance to ſeize upon His Perſon, unleſs in time He did provide for His Liberty. Nor could it be imagined that He meditated a War, who to make His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy (if they had not deſpiſed their own Mercies) had deprived Himſelf of a power to manage it. For beſides thoſe Acts formerly mentioned, He had ſigned many other as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to ſuch an undertaking. For He had paſſed Acts againſt His own Power of Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Souldiers, His Right to Tonnage and Poundage, the Stannary Courts, Clerk of the Market, the Preſidial Courts in the North, and Marches of <hi>Wales;</hi> whereby He had not only diminiſhed His Greatneſs, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which was due to the Crown, but alſo ſo ſtraitned His Revenue as it was not able to maintain <hi>Diſcipline, without which no hopes of Victory, eſpecially in a Civil War.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, His Enemies in every County had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured His <hi>Fame,</hi> which <hi>is of great moment in the deciding Controverſies by the Sword;</hi> and the City of <hi>London,</hi> which is the grand Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of the Wealth and Strength of the whole
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104649:51"/>Nation, was now enſlaved by the Rabble to their commands. All which conſiderations as they could not eſcape ſo Wiſe a Prince, ſo would they not permit the Deſigns of War, eſpecially in that Breaſt, to which it was equally miſerable to ſuffer the ſpilling of His Subjects blood, as to expoſe Himſelf to Ruine. So that His departure from <hi>London</hi> was not of Deſign, but Neceſſity, nor was there in it more of Fear than Shame; for He could no longer endure thoſe deteſtable <hi>Spectacula</hi> in which Tumults like Beaſts were let looſe to aſſault the Majeſty of Government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus provides for His Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Faction proceed to uſurp the <hi>Militia,</hi> which His Majeſty had denied, and the Lords were aſhamed to ask: therefore they privately incourage their Partiſans in all the Cities and Boroughs where they were moſt powerfull, to appoint Muſters, to arm and train their Youth, and module them into Companies; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (though contrary to the Law) they move the Lower Houſe to Vote Legal, and to make an Order in the Name of the Parliament for the Conſtituting of Deputies to the ſame purpoſe in every County: and at laſt, by the Tumults which they raiſed, the Threats they uſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge the names of the diſſenting Lords, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret promiſes to ſome others (for Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> told the Earl of <hi>Dover, he muſt look for no Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unleſs he joyned with them</hi>) they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104649:52"/>upon the Houſe of Peers, when many of the moſt eminent were abſent, to joyn in a Petition for the <hi>Militia,</hi> upon pretence of great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at home, and more prodigious terrours from abroad, pretending that by Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from <hi>Paris, Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> they were aſſured of great deſigns to overthrow the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, together with the Proteſtant Religion; (whoſe fate and Intereſt they would have it imagined, was ſo twiſted with theirs, that like thoſe Twins they could not laugh nor grieve but in Conjunction.) This Paper being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to His Majeſty, whoſe Soul was wholly devoted to Peace, when it did not betray Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Truſt Heaven had committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, He propoſes to them Expedients where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be aſſociated with Him in the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience forbad Him to deveſt Himſelf wholly of, and paſſionately adjures them to lay aſide their vain and empty Terrours, whereby they diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and divided the People, not ſuffering them to enjoy the Peace and Gracious Conceſſions wherein He had exceeded the Goodneſs of all His Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>But they, who had projected to themſelves the whole Power, would not be contented with a Partner in it, and therefore deſpiſing His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and neglecting His Admonitions, the next day in furious Votes declared themſelves ſole Maſters of the <hi>Militia:</hi> and to make the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104649:52"/>People believe there was truth in their falſe Fears, they command ſtrict Watches to be kept in all ſuſpected places, Beacons to be new ſet up, the Sea-marks to be watched, and the Navy to be new rigged and fitted for the Sea. New Plots were alſo diſcovered, and Strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Counſels to murder the moſt Eminent Patriots are brought to light. <hi>A Taylor in a ditch hears ſome deſperate Cavaliers contriving the Death of</hi> Mr. Pym. <hi>A Plaiſter alſo taken from a Plague-ſore was ſent into the Houſe to the ſame perſon, that the Infection firſt ſeiſing on a Member of the quickeſt ſenſes, might thence more impetuouſly diffuſe it ſelf upon all the moſt Grave Senators.</hi> Such like Plots as theſe, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could be deviſed, were publiſhed to make the Vulgar think thoſe demands of the Faction ſeem modeſt, (their dangers being ſo great) which were very unjuſt.</p>
            <p>And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould at His coming into the North make uſe of that Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> (which at His own Charges He had provided for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition) for His own defence, the Faction, to ſecure that and the Town for their future purpoſes, ſend down Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> without any Order or Commiſſion from either Houſe of Parliament, to ſeiſe on them. This Man of a fury and impudence equal to their Commands, when the <hi>King,</hi> petitioned by the Gentlemen of <hi>York-ſhire</hi> to employ thoſe Arms and that Ammunition for the Safety and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104649:53"/>Peace of that County, (where ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Members of Parliament had begun to form the like Seditions with thoſe of <hi>London,</hi>) would have entred <hi>Hull,</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1642.] <hi>April</hi> 23. inſolently ſhut the Gates upon Him, and would not permit Him, though with but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Attendants, for He offered to leave the Guard of Noblemen and Gentlemen which followed Him without. The <hi>King</hi> thereupon Proclaims him Traytor, and by Letters complains of the Indignity, and requires Satisfaction. But the Faction rendred the Act ſo glorious, that the Houſe of Commons by their Votes approved what he had done without their Command, and clamoured that the <hi>King</hi> had done them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in proclaiming ſo innocent a Member, Traytor: Ordered the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to whom they had committed the Command of the Navy, to land ſome men out of the Ships at <hi>Hull,</hi> and to tranſport the Magazine there from thence to <hi>London.</hi> An Order of Aſſiſtance was alſo given to ſeveral of their Confidents, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Houſes to reſide at <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> were commanded to execute their commands. Beſides, they ſent a Commiſſion to <hi>Hotham</hi> to proſecute the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies he had begun, and kindle that War which took fire on the whole Nation, and in a ſhort ſpace conſumed him and his Son, who were executed by the Inſtructors of his Villany: For he fell under that ſame Fate which attends all the Inſtruments of Great Crimes, to be Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104649:53"/>and ſuſpected by thoſe that made uſe of them. Therefore they gave ſuch a power to the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> as did conclude the diminution, and ſubmiſſion of <hi>Hotham</hi> to His Commands. This cauſed him to reflect with grief and madneſs upon his firſt miniſtery to the Faction, which appeared every day more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous to his Conſcience, being now ſpoiled of that Grandeur that he hoped would have been its reward, and awakened by thoſe Deſolations in the whole Kingdom which followed it, and were but as the Copies of his Original Treaſon. Therefore he thought to expiate his former guilt by ſurrendring the Town to Him from whom he had detained it. But his practices were diſcovered to the Faction by One whom they had ſent thither in pretence to preach the Goſpel, but in truth ſecretly to ſearch into the intrigues of his Counſels: ſo that he periſhed in his deſign, being neither ſtout nor wiſe enough in juſt enterpriſes, nor of a pertinacy ſufficient for a proſperous Perfidiouſneſs. And although in his Ruine the <hi>King</hi> obſerved how great a draught was offered to the higheſt thirſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, yet He did truly bewail him: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was ſo much the more to be pitied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his cruel Maſters deluded him to a ſilence of their black Secrets with a falſe hope of Life till the Ax was upon his Neck. So betraying his Soul to a ſurpriſe by his Spiritual enemies, as his pretended Spiritual Guides had done his Body to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:104649:54"/>The Inſolency of <hi>Hotham,</hi> who acted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Inſtructions and late Commiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning acts not uſual in Peace, nor juſtifiable by Law, (for he iſſued out Warrants for the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands to march into <hi>Hull</hi> with their Arms, where he forced them to leave them, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly return to their homes, that ſo they might be obnoxious to his Violence) and the practices of the Committee which were ſent down into the North, to debauch the People in their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, made the <hi>King</hi> intend His own Security by a Guard; which the Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> that were witneſſes of the Injury offered to their Prince, did willingly and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make up. No ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> expreſſed His intention of ſuch a Guard, but the Faction, who were watchful of all opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a War, and ingaging thoſe that either through Fear or Weakneſs had hitherto ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Impoſtures, in a more obliging guilt, (for now the greateſt part of the Peers, who were of the moſt Ancient Families and Nobleſt Fortunes, and a very great number of the Houſe of Commons, Perſons of juſt hopes and fair E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, who perceiving the deſigns of the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſcorned any longer to be their Slaves, yet not thinking it ſafe to provoke the fury of the Vulgar Tumults by a preſent oppoſition, had withdrawn from the Parliament to follow the <hi>King</hi> and His Fortune, and every day ſome more were ſtill falling off) took this occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104649:54"/>our Miſeries, and open thoſe Sluces of Blood which polluted the whole Kingdom. For upon the firſt Intelligence of it they filled the Houſe of Commons and the City with Clamours, That <hi>His Majeſty had now taken Arms to the overthrow of them and the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and that <hi>they were not any longer to think the Happineſs of the Kingdom did depend upon the</hi> King, <hi>or any of the Regal Branches of that Stock; that it would argue no want either of Duty or Modeſty, if they ſhould depoſe Him.</hi> By theſe Harangues they ſo heated the Parliament, that was now more penurious than before in perſons of Honour and Conſcience, to ſuch a degree of Fury, that unmindful how they themſelves for eight months before upon impoſſible Fears and improbable Jealouſies had taken a Guard, they Reſolved upon the Queſtion, that the <hi>King by taking to himſelf ſuch a Guard did intend to levy War against the Parliament.</hi> With an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall fury they Iſſue out Commiſſions into all parts of the Kingdom, and appoint certain days for all the Trained Bands to be put into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of War, ſending down ſome of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to ſee to the execution of theſe Commands, and to ſeiſe on the Magazines in the ſeveral Counties.</p>
            <p>To all theſe their violent and unjuſt attempts the <hi>King</hi> firſt oppoſes the Law, in ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations manifeſts the Power of Arms to be the Ancient and undoubted Right of the Crown,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104649:55"/>by many Proclamations, Charges all Men under the Crime and Penalties of Treaſon to forbear the Execution of thoſe Ordinances which were publiſhed to Licence their Rebellion, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with a wonderful Diligence and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence all the fictitious Pretenſions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to that Power, in their ſeveral Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances. But though the <hi>King</hi> had in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all underſtanding and unintereſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Juſter Cauſe, and the more powerful Pen, yet the Faction's <hi>Haſte, which is moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious in Civil Diſcords,</hi> the Slanders they had raiſed of Him, and impreſſed in the minds of the People, the terrours of that Arbitrary Power which the Houſe of Commons had a long while exerciſed in the vexatious proſecution of all ſuch as did oppoſe their imperious Reſolves, (for they would by their Meſſengers ſend for the Great Earls and Prime Barons of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as Rogues and Felons, and weary them and others with a tedious and chargeable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, oppreſs them with heavy and unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Cenſures, and reſtrain them by Illegal Impriſonments) and the hopes of licence and ſpoil in the ruine of Church and State, had ſo preoccupated the Minds of the inferiour Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that neither Law nor Religion could have the leaſt conſideration in their practices; and thoſe Perſons whom His Majeſty appointed as Commiſſioners of <hi>Array,</hi> in few places found that Obedience which was due to the juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a Gracious Prince, who vainly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104649:55"/>that Reverence to Juſtice in others which Himſelf gave.</p>
            <p>After the experience of their Power in theſe their Succeſſes at Land, and having gotten the whole Navy at Sea, being made Maſters of the moſt and greateſt Strengths of the Kingdom, they then thought it might be ſafe for them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the aims and ends of their moſt deſtructive deſigns; which if ſooner manifeſted, when the <hi>King</hi> by His Meſſage of 20. of <hi>January</hi> from <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle adviſed them <hi>to preſcribe the limits of their Priviledges, give full Boundaries to His own Power, and propoſe what was in their judgements proper to make the People happy; and moſt religiouſly promiſed an equal tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs and the Peoples Rights as of His own, and what was for the Publick Good ſhould not be obſtructed for His Particular emolument;</hi> they had juſtly drawn upon themſelves all that popular hatred which they endeavoured to fling upon the <hi>King,</hi> and had been buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ruines which they projected for the Grave of Majeſty. But then the Faction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided not ſo much in their own force, nor were the Vulgar then ſo blinded with fury as to chuſe their own Deſtruction: and therefore to that Meſſage of Peace nothing was returned but Complaints, That <hi>by ſuch Adviſoes their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were diſturbed, that it was contrary to their unbounded Privileges to be minded of what was neceſſary.</hi> But now they were furniſhed with a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104649:56"/>Power equal to their Ambition, they thought it expedient to confirm their newly-gotten Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with ſome pretenſions to Peace; but with a great deal of Caution, that the affectation of it might not diſappoint them of their hopes, which were all built upon War and Confuſion. Therefore they formed the Conditions ſuch as the <hi>King</hi> could not in Honour or Conſcience grant them, nor expect Peace by them. Or if He did, they ſhould be inſtated in ſuch a Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, that they might reap for themſelves all the reproachful Honours and unlawful gains of an Arbitrary Power, the thing they aimed at, and leave the <hi>King</hi> overwhelmed with ſhame and contempt for their miſcarriages in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe Conditions were digeſted into Nineteen Propoſitions; which when preſented to the <hi>King,</hi> He ſaw by an aſſent to them He ſhould be concluded to have depoſed Himſelf, and be but as an helpleſs and idle Spectator of the Miſeries ſuch Tyrants would bring upon the People whom God had committed to His Truſt. Therefore He gave them that denial which they really deſired and expected, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſts His refuſal in a Declaration, wherein He ſets forth the Injuſtice of each Propoſition. His Anſwer He ſent by the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> and Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Perſons of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Prudence, with Inſtructions to Treat in the Houſe of Peers upon more equal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:104649:56"/>But it behoved the Faction not to let the Kingdom ſee any way to Peace, therefore deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any admittance to thoſe Lords, before ever the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer could publickly diſcover who were the obſtructours of the Peoples quiet, they Ordered a Collection to be made of Money and Plate, to maintain Horſe, Horſe-men and Arms for the enſuing War. The ſpecious Pretences for which were <hi>the Safety of the King's Perſon, and the taking Him out of the hands of Evil Counſellors, the Defence of the Priviledges of Parliament, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the maintenance of the Ancient Laws of the Land.</hi> Such inviting cauſes as theſe inflamed the Minds of the Multitude, and filled them with more airy hopes of Victory than the noiſe of Drums and Trumpets: But that which was moſt powerful were the Sermons of ſuch who, being diſpleaſed with the preſent Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Covernment, were promiſed the richeſt Benefices, and a partage of the Revenues which belonged to Biſhops, Deans and Chapiters. Theſe from their Pulpits proclaimed War in the Name of Chriſt the Prince of Peace, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was contributed to the ſpilling of the blood of the Wicked, was to build up the Throne of the meekeſt Lamb; and beſides the ſatisfaction they were to expect from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which the Parliament promiſed, there was a larger Intereſt to be doubled upon them in the Kingdom of Saints that was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104649:57"/>Deluded by theſe Artifices and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, People of all Conditions and all Sexes, ſome carried by a ſecret Inſtinct, others hurried by ſome furious Zeal, and a laſt ſort led by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, caſt into this Holy Treaſury the Banck for Blood, all the Ornaments of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, all their Silver Veſſels, even to their Spoons, with the Pledges of their firſt Love, their Marriage-rings; and the younger Females ſpared not their Thimbles and Bodkins, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Gifts of their <hi>Inamorato</hi>'s, from being a part of the Price of Blood. But while theſe Preparations were made at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>York</hi> Declares againſt the Scandal, that <hi>He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Levy War againſt the Parliament,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God to witneſs how far His deſires and thoughts were from it; and alſo thoſe many Lords who were witneſſes of His Counſels and Actions, do publiſh to the World by a Writing ſubſcribed with all their Names, to the number of Forty and odd, that <hi>they ſaw not any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Preparations or Counſels that might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably beget the belief of any ſuch Deſign, and were fully perſwaded that He had no ſuch intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all was in vain, for the Faction choſe that the People ſhould be rather guilty of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rebellion, than only of favouring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of it, and decreed to try whether by a proſperous Succeſs they could change their Crimes to Vertue. Therefore they haſtened all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104649:57"/>they could to raiſe Horſe and Foot to form an Army equal to their Uſurpation: which was not difficult for them to do, for they being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Multitudes deſirous of Novelty were eaſily amaſſed for any enterpriſe, eſpecially when the entring into this Warfare might make the Servant freer than his Maſter, (for ſuch was the Licence was indulged to thoſe Youths that would ſerve the Cauſe) 20000 were ſooner gathered than the <hi>King</hi> could get 500. The City alſo could afford them more Ordnance than the <hi>King</hi> could promiſe to Himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Muskets: and to pay their Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the vaſt ſumms that were gathered for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (which though they by their own Act had decreed ſhould not be uſed for any other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, yet now diſpence with their Faith, and imploy it to make <hi>England</hi> as miſerable as that Iſland) and the Contributions of the deluded ſouls for this War; they ſeiſed alſo upon the Revenues of the <hi>King, Queen, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and plunder the Houſes of thoſe Lords and Gentlemen whom they ſuſpected to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe. And in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of theſe advantages, they promiſed their credulous party an undoubted Victory, and to lead Majeſty Captive in Triumph through <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> within a Month, by the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom they appointed General.</p>
            <p>Thus did they drive that Juſt and Gracious <hi>Prince</hi> to ſeek His Safety by neceſſary Arms,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104649:58"/>ſince nothing worſe could befall Him after a ſtout, though unhappy, Reſiſtance, than He was to hope for in a tame Submiſſion to their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Therefore though He perfectly abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe Sins which are the Conſequences of War, yet He wanted not Courage to attempt at Victory, notwithſtanding it ſeemed almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible againſt ſo well-appointed an Enemy. Therefore with an incredible diligence moving from place to place, from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> from thence to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Wales,</hi> by diſcovering thoſe Abilities with which His Soul was richly fraught unto His deluded Subjects, He appeared not only worthy of their Reverence, but of their Lives and Fortunes for His Defence; and in all places incouraging the Good with His Commendations, exciting the Fearful by His Example, diſſembling the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of His Friends, but alwayes praiſing their Vertues, He ſo prevailed upon thoſe who were not men of many Times, nor by a former Guilt debauch'd to Inhumanity, that He had quickly contracted an Army greater than His Enemies expected, and which was every day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by thoſe Lords and Gentlemen who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be polluted any longer with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Faction by ſitting among them, and being Perſons of large Fortunes had raiſed their Friends and Tenants to ſuccour that Majeſty that now laboured under an Eclipſe. Moſt men being moved with Pity and Shame to ſee their Prince, whoſe former Reign had made them
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104649:58"/>wanton in Plenty, to be driven from His own Palaces, and concluded under a want of Bread, to be neceſſitated to implore their aid, for the preſervation of His and their Rights. So that notwithſtanding all the Impoſtures of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the Corruptions of the Age, there were many great Examples of Loyalty and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Many Noble Perſons did almoſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh themſelves to ſupply the <hi>King</hi> with Men and Money. Some Private men made their way through numerous dangers to joyn with, and fight under His Colours. Many great Ladies and Vertuous Matrons parted with the Ornaments of their Sex to relieve His wants, and ſome bravely defended their Houſes in His Cauſe when their Lords were otherwhere ſeeking Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in His Service. Both the Univerſities free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted their Plate to ſuccour their Prince, the Supreme Patron and Incourager of all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Queen pawned Her Jewels to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide neceſſaries for the Safety of Her Husband. Which Duty of Hers, though it deſerved the Honour of all Ages, was branded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues with the imputation of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and unexpected growth of the Strength of the <hi>King</hi> after ſo many years of Slanders, and ſuch induſtrious Plots to make Him odious and Contemptible, raiſed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all men, and the fears of that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Party who had given up their Faith to the Faction, when they repreſented the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:104649:59"/>guilty of ſo much Folly and Vice (and ſome corrupted Citizens had repreſented Him as a Prodigie of both in a Scene at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> an Art uſed by Jeſuites to impreſs more deeply a Calumny,) that they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any perſon of Prudence or Conſcience would appear in His Service, and they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day when, deſerted by all as a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, He ſhould in Chains deliver Himſelf up to the Commands of the Parliament. <q>Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed this ſtrange increaſe in power to <hi>the natural Affection of the Engliſh to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sovereign, from whom though the Arts and Impulſes of Seditious Demagogues may a while eſtrange and divorce their minds, yet their Genius will irreſiſtibly at laſt force them to their firſt Love;</hi> and therefore they urged the ſaying of that Obſerving States-man, that <hi>if the Crown of</hi> England <hi>were placed but on an Hedge-ſtake, he would be on that ſide where the Crown was.</hi> Others referred it to the full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the wickedneſs of His Adverſaries, for their Counſels were now diſcovered, and their Ends manifeſt, not to maintain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty, which was equally hatefull to them as Tyranny when it was not in their hands, but to acquire a Grandeur and Power that might ſecure and adminiſter to their Luſts: and it was now every where publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Anſwered to one who inquired <hi>What they did expect from the</hi> King; he replyed, <hi>That He ſhould commit Himſelf
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104649:59"/>and all that is His to our Care.</hi> Others aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it to the fears of ruine to thoſe numerous Families and Myriads of people which the change of Government deſigned by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament muſt neceſſarily effect. But this, though it argued that <hi>Cauſe exceeding bad by which ſo great a part of a Community is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed, without any abſolute neceſſity for preſerving the whole;</hi> yet made but an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Addition to the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Power was built upon Perſons of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Extract and the faireſt Eſtates in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of which they could not eaſily ſuſpect to be deveſted without an abſolute overthrow of all the Laws of Right and Wrong, which nevertheleſs was to be feared by their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt undoubted Rights. For <hi>when Majeſty it ſelf is aſſaulted, there can be no ſecurity for private Fortunes; and thoſe that decline upon deſign from the paths of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will never reſt till they come to the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Injuſtice;</hi> as theſe afterwards did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that imputed the ſpeedy amaſſing of theſe Forces to the Equity of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe, His moſt Powerful Eloquence, Indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Induſtry, and moſt Obliging Converſe; there were another ſort that, ſuſpending their Judgements till all the Scenes of War were paſſed, reſolved all into the Providence of God: Who though He were pleaſed to ſingle Him out of all the Kings of the Earth as the ſitteſt Champion to wreſtle with Adverſity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104649:60"/>and to make Him glorious by <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which <hi>being well born truly prove men Great;</hi> yet would He furniſh Him (almoſt by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) likewiſe with ſuch Advantages, in the conduct of which His Prudence and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity might evidence that He did deſerve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and by clearing up even this way His eminent Vertues, warn the following Ages from a Credulity to unquiet Perſons, ſince the beſt of Princes was thus infamouſly ſlandered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all theſe concurring Cauſes, each one in their Way and Order, did the <hi>King</hi>'s ſtrength ſo far increaſe, as that He won many Battels, and was not far from Conqueſt in the Whole War; had not God ſeen fit to afflict this ſinful Nation with Numerous and moſt Impious Tyrants, and make us feel, that <hi>no Oppreſſions are ſo unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable as thoſe which are impoſed by ſuch as have made the higheſt Pretenſions to Liberty:</hi> of which we had bitter experience after the War was ſiniſhed that was now begun. For there had been ſome ſlight Conflicts e're this in the ſeveral Counties betwixt the Commiſſioners of <hi>Array</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> with various Succeſſes; which require juſt Volumes and compleat Hiſtories to relate, and cannot be comprehended in the ſhort View of the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, where it is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſpeak of thoſe Battels in which the King in Perſon gave ſufficient evidence of His Wiſdom and Valour. The firſt of which was at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> on <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. For the <hi>King</hi> had no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104649:60"/>ſooner gotten a conſiderable Force, though not equal to thoſe of His Enemies, but He marched towards <hi>London,</hi> and in His way thither met with <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army that were come from thence to take Him. The <hi>King</hi> having viewed their Army by a Proſpective-glaſs from the top of that Hill, and being asked afterwards by His Officers what He meant to do, <hi>To give them battel</hi> (ſaid He with a preſent Courage) <hi>it is the firſt time I ever ſaw the Rebels in a body: God, and good mens Prayers to Him, aſſist the Juſtice of My Cauſe:</hi> and immediately prepared for the Fight; which was acted with ſuch a fury, that near 6000 (according to the common Account, but ſome ſay a far leſs number) were ſlain upon the place. Night concluded this Battel, which had comprehended the whole War, had not the <hi>King</hi>'s prevailing Horſe preferr'd the Spoils to Victory, and left the Enemy ſome advantage to diſpute for her. But the <hi>King</hi> had all the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt marks of her favour. For though He had loſt His General, yet He kept the Field, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dead Bodies, opened His way toward <hi>London,</hi> and in the ſight of ſome part of the Army of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (who accounted it a Victory that He was not totally routed and killed,) took <hi>Banbury,</hi> and entred Triumphantly into <hi>Oxford</hi> (which He had deſigned for His Winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) with 150 Colours taken in ſight. And having aſſured that place, He advances towards <hi>London,</hi> whither <hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten before Him, and diſpoſed his baſſled Regiments within ten
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104649:61"/>miles of the City; yet the <hi>King</hi> fell upon two Regiments of them at <hi>Brainford,</hi> took 500 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ſunk their Ordnance. From thence intending to draw nearer <hi>London,</hi> He had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the <hi>City</hi> had poured forth all their Auxiliaries to re-inforce <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Troops; to which being unwilling to oppoſe His Souldiers wearied with their March, nor thinking it ſafe to force an Enemy to fight upon <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which <hi>inſpires a more than Ordinary Fury,</hi> He retreats to <hi>Oxford,</hi> having taught His Enemies, that He was not eaſily to be Overcome.</p>
            <p>For in the management of this Battel, He did not only undeceive the abuſed world of thoſe Slanders which His Enemies had polluted Him with, but He exceeded that Opinion His own Party had of His Abilities. And though He parted from <hi>London</hi> altogether unexperienced in Martial affairs, yet at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> He appeared a moſt Excellent Commander. His Valour was alſo equal to His Prudence, and He could as well endure Labours as deſpiſe Dangers. And by a communication of toils, encouraged His Souldiers to keep the Field all the night, when they ſaw He refuſed the refreſhments of a Bed; for He ſought no other Shelter from the injuries of the Air than His own Coach. Theſe Vertues and this Succeſs made ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Parliament, that though they took all courſes to hide the Infamy of their worſted Army, yet in more humble Expreſſions than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

But the Faction, who were frighted with theſe Tendencies to an Accommodation, cauſe ſome of the City to Petition againſt it, and to make profer of their Lives and Fortunes for the proſecution of the War. Encouraged by this they form their Propoſitions like the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Conquerours, and ſo ſtreighten the Power and Time of their Commiſſioners, that the Treaty at <hi>Oxford</hi> became fruitleſs, which there had taken up all the <hi>King</hi>'s employment this Winter, though abroad His Forces were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in ſeveral Parts of the Nation, not without honour.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1643.] At the Opening of the Spring the Queen comes back to <hi>England,</hi> bringing with Her ſome conſiderable Supplies of Men, Money and Ammunition, and Her coming was entertained with ſuch a Series of Succeſſes, that the <hi>King</hi> that Summer was Maſter of the North and Weſt, except ſome few Garriſons. Which ſo diſmayed the Parliament, that very many of them were preparing to quit the Kingdom: and had the <hi>King</hi> followed His own Counſels, to march immediately towards <hi>London,</hi> and not been fatally over-born at a Council of War, (which, it is ſaid, His Enemies at <hi>London</hi> did aſſure their Party would ſo be) firſt to attempt <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> He had, in the judgement of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning men, then finiſhed the War with Glory.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104649:62"/>But here He lay ſo long till <hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten a Recruit from <hi>London,</hi> and came time enough to relieve the Town; though in his return the <hi>King</hi> neceſſitated him to fight, worſted him near <hi>Newbery,</hi> and ſo bravely followed him the next day, that He forced the Parliaments Horſe which were left in the Reer to ſeek their ſafety by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their way over a great part of their Foot; yet loſt on His ſide much Noble Blood, as the Earls of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Falkland.</hi> This laſt was lamented by all, being equally dexterous at the Pen and Sword, had won ſome Wreathes in thoſe Controverſies that were to be managed by Reaſon, and was eminent in all the Generous parts of Learning, above any of his Fortune and Dignity. After this Encounter the <hi>King</hi> returns to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to Conſult with thoſe Members of both Houſes that had left the Impoſtures and Tumults at <hi>London,</hi> to joyn with Him for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, who being as to the Peers the far greater, and as to the Commons an equal Number with thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> they aſſumed the Name and Authority of Parliament, and deliberated of the ways of Peace, and means to prevent the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the Faction ſo furiouſly deſigned, who were now reſolving to encreaſe our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Calling in the <hi>Scots</hi> to their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>For though they pretended ſo highly to God's Cauſe, as if they had the certainty of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, yet they would not truſt Him
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104649:62"/>for their Preſervation, notwithſtanding their pretences to his Cauſe had furniſhed them with ſo vaſt a Treaſure and ſo mighty a Strength; but would invite others to the Violation of moſt ſacred Oaths, to ſin againſt all Laws and every Rule of Juſtice, that themſelves might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their Uſurpations. And that Perfidious Party that then ruled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping for as great advantages as their former Wickedneſs had yielded, contrary to all Obligations which the <hi>King</hi>'s Goodneſs had laid on them, and their free and Voluntary Execrations, (as was that of <hi>Alexander Leſley,</hi> who lifting up his arms and hands to Heaven, wiſhed <hi>they might rot to his body before he died, if ever he ſhould heave them up hereafter, or draw his ſword, againſt ſo gude a King,</hi>) drew that People once more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rebellion againſt their Prince; and to make them more eager, and think the Enterpriſe eaſie, they firſt raiſed a report that the <hi>King</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by moſt of His Nobility.</p>
            <p>The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> having by a Letter moved the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to endeavour Peace, did alſo declare againſt this Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> by another Letter ſent to them, in which alſo they acquaint them with the falſneſs of their officious Lie, and ſhew how inconſiderable a Number of Lords were with thoſe that invited them in. The <hi>King</hi> Himſelf writes alſo to put them in mind of their ſeveral Ingagements to be Quiet. But with an Inſolencie fit for moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104649:63"/>Souls, they Commanded the Letters to be burned by the hand of the Hangman. A more ſecret falſhood He alſo found in the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> whoſe Treaſons now came to be more ſuſpected. For His Majeſty having written to him, to uſe all his Power and Intereſt to keep his Country-men at home, (which had not been difficult for one of his Grandeur in that unquiet Nation) he by ſome ſecret Arts doth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them; and to cover his Perfidiouſneſs, flies from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as ſeeking a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his Loyalty; but indeed to be a Spy in the <hi>King</hi>'s Counſels. But his Treaſons had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripp'd him and his Brother, the Earl of <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> who came with him, therefore they were both forbidden the Court. <hi>Lanerick</hi> not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to tarry till a further Diſcovery, gets out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> flies to thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> and by them was imployed in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army; which made <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Treachery more evident, and he was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle. But the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of that Nation was in a great meaſure repaired by the Gallantry and Faithfulneſs of the Marqueſs <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who being commiſſion'd by the <hi>King,</hi> with an incredible Induſtry by ſmall numbers of men won many Battels, and overthrew well-formed Armies: and had not the Fate of his Maſter, which was to be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe He truſted, been likewiſe common to him, he had forced that Nation to Juſtice and Quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:104649:63"/>But e're <hi>Montroſs</hi> could get his Commiſſion, the <hi>Scots</hi> were entred <hi>England:</hi> whoſe coming that it might be leſs odious to the People, who now grew cold in their zeal to the Cauſe, and ſaw themſelves deluded into ſo continued dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Faction make uſe of ſuch frauds as ſhould make the People either think them neceſſary aſſiſtances, or might divert their thoughts from apprehending the Miſeries they brought with them to this Nation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they invent new Slanders of the <hi>King</hi> and His Party. <hi>That His Majeſty did intend to tranſlate Monarchy into a Tyranny: that He would ſeiſe upon all their Eſtates who had any way oppoſed Him, and make their perſons Slaves: that there was no hope of Pardon from Him, who was ſo mercileſs: that He would take away all their Liberties and Privileges as forfeited, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, and introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which at</hi> Oxford <hi>He did practiſe Himſelf, and that all men muſt be forced to go to Maſs.</hi> As for His Party they ſet them out to be ſuch Monſters, that the lower ſort of People doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the Cavaliers had the ſhapes of men. For ſad Relations were printed and publiſhed of their inhumanity and barbarous murders: that <hi>they did feaſt upon the Fleſh of Men, and that they fed their Dogs and their Horſes with the ſame Diet, to make them more fierce for the blood of the Godly Party: that no mans houſe was ſo poor and mean that a Cavalier would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104649:64"/>think beneath his rapine.</hi> Thus they wrought upon the melancholy ſpirits of ſome by fear. For thoſe of a moroſe and cholerick temper they had proper divertiſements: they permitted to them a tumultuary Reformation, to pull down the Pictures and Images of Chriſt, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Saints; which with great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they committed to the flames, that they might ſuffer as it were another Martyrdom. All Croſſes, though ſet up for Ornament and Uſe in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and other places, they pulled down: they invade the Churches, and there deface what their Humour or Rapine would call Superſtition, pull down the Organs, tear the Surplices; and all this was ſuffered to pleaſe the Rabble, who delight in violences and ſuch oſtentations of their fury, and to make them in ſomething or other guilty, that they might deſpair of Pardon.</p>
            <p>For others, who were to be wrought upon by Religion, they entertain them with Faſts, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Thankſgivings for ſlight Victories, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Spiritual meetings (as they called them;) where whatſoever the Faction dictated was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Speakers to their unwary hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as the Oracles of Heaven: and being thus wrapp'd up in thoſe true delights which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Worſhip of God, they were ſecurely ſwallowed by them, as Poiſon when it is offered in a Sacramental Chalice. To pleaſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters whom hitherto they had uſed as their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104649:64"/>Properties and Inſtruments of their Arts, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is ſet up, that they alſo might have an Imaginary Empire: but it was not intended they ſhould exerciſe it. For the pretenſions of that to a <hi>Divine Right</hi> did ſo terrifie them who were reſolved againſt all Government that was not ſubject unto or dependent on theirs, that they preſently raiſed all the other Sects, <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Eraſtians,</hi> (who for the moſt part were Lawyers, that could not endure to hear of any Thunderbolts of Excommunication, but what was heated in their own forges) <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> (of which there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſprung up, who ſeeing how Religion was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to carnal and unjuſt Ends, began firſt to deſpiſe that, and afterwards to deny God) to write and declaim againſt this new Politie, as the moſt ſevere and abſolute Tyranny under the Sun, and the tenth Perſecution. But this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modeſty of admitting a Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerved their ends for the preſent, till they could acquire a greater ſtrength, in confidence of which they might ſlight the Terrours of the Law, and the Anathema's of the Church. The Liturgy alſo was aboliſhed, under pretence of a Spiritual Liberty, for it was accuſed of putting a reſtraint upon the Spirit, but in truth, becauſe it had ſo frequent Offices for the <hi>King.</hi> To theſe were added the Covenant, the Fetters of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Slavery: this was to bind the whole Nation to the Intereſts of the Faction, and was uſed as the <hi>Water of Jealouſie,</hi> to diſcover thoſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104649:65"/>whom they did ſuſpect. Therefore all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, of what Sect ſoever, whether Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents or Anabaptiſts, though they refuſed to take it themſelves, (becauſe it did oblige to the Preſervation of the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) yet were as eager Impoſers of it as the Presbyterians (who in ſimplicity urged it as the Fundamental Conſtitution of their Empire) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all who they thought would not proſtitute their Souls to their deſigns, or had any thing fit to be made their Spoils. And by this only En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine many thouſand Perſons and Families were miſerably ruined, eſpecially of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>To oblige more faſtly thoſe that had no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to expect nor hopes to receive any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their Service againſt their <hi>Prince</hi> in the other life, and ſo would not be ſatisfied with the ſhews of Religion, but ſought more ſolid encouragements in the ſpoils of it, the Lands of the Biſhops were expoſed to ſale, and that at ſuch eaſie rates as might invite the hazards of the Purchaſe, ſatiate their boundleſs Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ingage them in a pertinacious faith to their Merchants. To cement all theſe diſtinct Humours in one common pleaſure, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was prepared for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and about this time began his Tryal, which continued a whole year, being when the Houſes were at leiſure called by ſeveral months and weeks to anſwer to his Charge, that by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent paſſages as a Priſoner he might give a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104649:65"/>pleaſant Diverſion to the <hi>Rabble, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ruines and misfortunes of great Perſons,</hi> and by their injuries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he might be reduced to ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit as was not competent with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Cauſe. But his Cauſe and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience were impregnable, and he overthrew their Slanders, though he could not their Power.</p>
            <p>By theſe Arts and Ways was the Winter ſpent to prepare for the attempts of the following Summer, wherein, [<hi>Anno</hi> 1644.] though the Parliaments Forces increaſed by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours had the Succeſs over ſeveral bodies of the Royaliſts, yet that ſmall Number that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, and were guided by His own Counſels and Example, obtained two great Victories. For His Majeſty having once more provided for the Safety of the Queen, (in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Her to <hi>Exceſter,</hi> there to lay down the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Her Love, and from thence to ſeek for Shelter in <hi>France</hi>) taken (contrary to their hopes) His laſt farewell of Her, and left <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſtrengthned againſt the Siege which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> threatned that place with, He with a ſmall party draws out, intending to form His Counſels according to the future Occurrences. This made the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my divide, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> was deſigned to reduce the Weſt. But <hi>Waller,</hi> with whom uſually went Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrigge</hi> (a Perſon fitter to raiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104649:66"/>Tumults than manage Armies) was to hunt the <hi>King</hi> upon the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> towards which He ſeemed to direct His courſe. But hearing of the reſolutions of theſe two jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Generals, He wheels about to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and from thence drew the greateſt ſtrength of that Garriſon, and with that falling upon <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Cropredy-bridge,</hi> obtained a great Victory; which would have been more prejudicial to the Enemy, had not the Tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood reſtrained Him from proſecuting His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to a greater ſlaughter. But contenting Himſelf to have diverted Injuries from His own breaſt, He only uſed this Victory for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Peace, which in a Letter from <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, July</hi> 4. He moves the Parliament unto.</p>
            <p>But the unquiet Criminals rendred it vain and fruitleſs, and repreſented to the People their yet prevailing Forces in the North, and their Army in the Weſt, which had now taken in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable places to their Obedience. Therefore to remove their Confidence in <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Power, the <hi>King</hi> follows him, and ſo cloſely purſues him, that He drove him up into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and there did as it were beſiege him. During which He ſent a Letter to him, which was ſeconded by another from the Lords and Gentlemen in His Army, to ſolicite His endeavours for the Peace and Quiet of the bleeding and waſted Kingdom. But it met not its deſired effect: Becauſe that Earl either valued not that ſolid
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104649:66"/>Glory of being the happy Author of a Nations Settlement; or feared that his paſt Actions had wholly deſpoiled him of hopes of Security in a return to Obedience, or knew that his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was not ſo great to put an Iſſue to thoſe Crimes which he had led others to commit. <hi>(For every inconſiderable perſon may be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at Diſturbances, but to form Peace requires much Wiſdom and great Vertues.)</hi> Which laſt was generally believed, for he had found and complained that his Credit declined with the Faction, that they were diſtruſtfull leſt their own Arts might teach him to have no faith to them, becauſe he often ſolicited them to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Kingdoms Diſtractions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore making no return to thoſe Letters, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his own ſafety in a <hi>Cock-boat,</hi> and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly deſerted his Army; of which the Horſe, taking the advantage of a dark night, made their eſcape, but the Commanders of the Foot did capitulate for their Lives, and left their Arms, Cannon, Baggage and Ammunition, to the Diſpoſal of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpeedy and prudent acquiſition of theſe two Victories ſhewed the <hi>King</hi> had thoſe Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that might have inſerted Him in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Braveſt Commanders; and had not want of Succeſs in His following Enterpriſes clouded the Glory of this Summer, He had been as eminent among the Maſters of War as He was among the Sons of Peace, the Honour of which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104649:67"/>laſt He moſt eagerly thirſted, as rendering Him moſt like that Majeſty He did repreſent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after this Victory, by a Letter from <hi>Tave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, Sept.</hi> 8. He re-inforces that from <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> for an Accord with the Parliament, being not tranſported from His Lenity by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with which Victory uſes to hurry humane breaſts to an inſolence. But He knew that <hi>Peace, though it is profitable to the Conquered, yet it is glorious for the Conquerour.</hi> To buſie His Army while He expected their Anſwer, and formed an Aſſociation in the Weſtern Counties, He ſits down before <hi>Plymmouth;</hi> but finding this Meſſage had an equal reception with the former, and that the Faction intended not to ſacrifice their ill-acquired Power and Uſurped Intereſts to the publick Tranquillity, He riſes from thence, and marches towards <hi>London,</hi> from whence were by this time in the way to meet Him <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> recruited, and joyned with the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Forces that were now returned from their Northern Services. And at <hi>Newbery</hi> both ſides joyn in an eager Fight, which being varied with different ſucceſſes, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diviſions, each party draw off by degrees, and neither found cauſe to boaſt of a Victory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament wearied with the Complaints of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Nation, who now grew impatient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſtractions, take into Conſideration His Majeſty's two Meſſages for Peace, and ſend
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104649:67"/>Propoſitions for it in the name of the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> united by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant. Which though they ſeemed the deſires of minds that intended nothing leſs than the common Tranquillity, yet the <hi>King</hi> neglects them not, but hoping that in a Treaty Commiſſioners might argue them into Reaſon, offers it, which with much difficulty the Houſes are drawn to accept; but yet would have it at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> a place but about fifteen miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and above twice that diſtance from <hi>Oxford.</hi> And accordingly Commiſſioners from both Parties met on <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. While the <hi>King</hi> was providing for the Treaty, and forming Inſtructions for His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Faction found the Parliament other work by new deſigns; and to habituate the People to an abhorrency of Peace, fed them with blood. The two <hi>Hotham</hi>'s firſt were to be the Sport of the Multitude: and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have more than a ſingle death, he was drawn back in his journey to the Scaffold, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. that his Son might be executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as he was <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. when after he had expreſſed his fury to thoſe Maſters whom they had ſerved to their ruines, his Head was chopt off. And on <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. the Father is brought to the place that was defiled with his Son's blood, and had his own added to it. Theſe were not much lamented by any, for the memory that they firſt kindled the Flame of the Nation kept every eye dry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:104649:68"/>The People thus fed with courſer blood, a cleaner Sacrifice was afterwards preſented, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of all <hi>England.</hi> He had indured Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment four years, and paſſed through a Tryal of many months, in which he had acquitted himſelf with ſuch a confidence as became the Innocency and Conſtancy of a Chriſtian Biſhop and Confeſſor, but yet muſt fall to pleaſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thoſe mercileſs men who imputed God's anger in the difficulties of Succeſs againſt their Prince, to the continuance of this Prelate's Life: therefore he was Voted Guilty of High Treaſon by the Houſe of Commons, and was condemned in the Houſe of Peers (though they have no power over the life of the meaneſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without the concurrence of the <hi>King</hi>) when there were but Seven Lords preſent,

And this was the firſt Example of murdering Men by Votes, of killing by an Order of Parliament, when there is no Law. It was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (they ſay) by ſome that he might be ſhipp'd over to <hi>New-England,</hi> to die by the Contempt and Malice of thoſe People. But this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104649:68"/>too great an Honour, becauſe it would make his end as his life was, much like that of the Primitive Biſhops, who for their Piety were baniſhed to Barbarous Coaſts, or condemned to the Mines. Or elſe it would be like an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Oſtraciſm, and confeſs him too great and good to live among us. Therefore this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was rejected; yet the Lords upon his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the diſtaſte of ſome Commons, changed the manner of that vile Execution to that more generous of being beheaded. To the Scaffold he was brought <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. after he had endured ſome affronts in his Antichamber in the Tower by ſome Sons of Schiſm and Sedition, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably that morning he was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to appear before the great Biſhop of our Souls, would have him give ſome ſatisfaction to the Godly (for ſo they called themſelves) for his Perſecutions, (which he called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.) To whom he Anſwered, <hi>That he was now ſhortly to give account of all his Actions at an higher and more equal Tribunal, and deſired he might not be diſturbed in his Preparations for it.</hi> When he came to the Scene of his death, he appeared with that chearfulneſs and ſerenity in his face, as a good Conſcience doth beautifie the owners with: and it was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, that his Enemies, who were aſhamed to ſee his Innocency pourtraied in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, did report he had drunk ſome Spirits, to force his nature from a paleneſs. He preached his own Funeral Sermon on that Text, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104649:69"/>and concluding his life with Prayer, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to the ſtroke of the Ax.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He was a Perſon of ſo great <hi>Abilities</hi> (which <hi>are the Deſignations of Nature to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Command,</hi>) that they raiſed him from low beginnings to the higheſt Office the Proteſtant Profeſſion acknowledges in the Church.

He was of ſo Publick a Spirit, that both the Church and State have laſting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Vertuous uſe of his Princes favour; at his Admittance into which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated all the future Emoluments of it to the Glory of God and the Good of Men, by a Projection of many noble Works: moſt of which he accompliſhed, and had finiſhed the reſt had not the Fate of the Nation checked the current of his Deſigns, and cut off the Courſe of his Life. He was not contented by himſelf only to ſerve his Generation, (for ſo he might have appeared more greedy of Fame, than deſirous of the Univerſal Benefit) but he endeavoured to render all others as heroick, if they aimed at a Capacity for his Friendſhip: for (I have heard it from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies) no geat man was admitted to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104649:69"/>and reſpect with him, unleſs he made his Addreſs by ſome Act that was for the Common Good, or for the Ornament and Glory of the Proteſtant Faith. Learned men had not a better Friend, nor Learning it ſelf a greater Advancer; he ſearched all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from ſeveral parts of the World purchaſed all the Ornaments and Helps of Literature he could, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church might have (if poſſible) by his Care as many Advantages for Knowledge as almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> did contribute to the Grandeur of that of <hi>Rome.</hi> The outward Splendour of the Clergy was not more his Care than their Honour by a grave and pious Converſation; he would put them into a power of doing more good, but was ſevere againſt their Vices and Vanities. He ſcorned a private Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his Kindred were rather relieved than raiſed to any greatneſs by him. In his Election of Friends, he was determinated to the Good and Wiſe, and ſuch as had both Parts and Deſires to profit the Church had his cloſeſt Embraces; if otherwiſe it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their frauds, not his choice, deſerved the blame. Both Papiſts and Sectaries were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually his Enemies; one party feared, and the other hated his Vertues. Some cenſured him of too much Heat, and a Zeal for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline above the Patience of the Times. But his geateſt unhappineſs, was, that he lived in a Factious Age, and Corrupt State, and under
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104649:70"/>ſuch a Prince, whoſe Vertues not admitting an immediate approach for Accuſations, was to be wounded in thoſe whom He did Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe. But when Faction and Malice are worn out by time, Poſterity ſhall ingrave him in the Albe of the Moſt Excellent Prelates, the moſt indulgent Fathers of the Church, and the moſt injured Martyrs.</q> His blood was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome tears that fell from thoſe Eyes which expected a pleaſure at his Death, and it had been followed with a more general mourning, had not the Publick Miſeries, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fears of Ruine exacted all the Stock of Grief for other objects.</p>
            <p>About this time the Faction clove into two Sects, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> which hitherto had been united under one name of <hi>Patriots,</hi> or <hi>Godly,</hi> had joyntly conſpired War and diſturbed the Peace, and by various Arts had acted all their luſts under the name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament. For they would either early in the morning before the Houſe was full, or late at night, when thoſe whoſe cares were moſt for the Publick were abſent, being aſſured of the Speaker, propoſe and Vote what ſerved for their Deſign. If any thing contrary to it was about to be reſolved in a full Aſſembly, they by multitude of Scruples would ſo diſturb the Debates, that the determination was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to a deſired Opportunity. But if theſe failed, then would they ſurpriſe the Houſe with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104649:70"/>another Vote that ſhould weaken and hinder the Execution of the former. When the moſt conſcientious were too numerous for them, then would they make neceſſities to ſend the leſs pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to their wills into the Country. Thus the Leſſer, but more induſtrious, Party did circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Greater, that were not ſo wary nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent. While they thus joyntly contrive the Publick Ruine, they had gotten themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt conſiderable and profitable Offices of the Kingdom. But the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> having the advantage in Number and Power, and the diſſenſion in their Opinions growing ſtill higher, by the Animoſities of the inferiour and obſcurer parts of their Sects, there was neither Faith nor Love among them, but what Fear and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity did force them unto. The <hi>Independents,</hi> who comprehended all the ſeveral herds of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Millenaries,</hi> &amp;c. though they were the Diſciples of the other, yet excelled their Maſters in Art and Induſtry, had their private <hi>Junto</hi>'s and meetings apart to mould their Projects, and aſſign to each of their Confidents their ſeveral Scenes and Methods; and, by proper Applications to mens ſeveral hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, had exceedingly encreaſed their ſtrength in the Multitude, only they wanted the Power of the Sword, and the moſt uſeful Offices to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Empire.</p>
            <p>This they effected by thoſe very practices they had learned from the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> and by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104649:71"/>procuring the Ordinance of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> (as they called it) they turned out <hi>Eſſex</hi> (whom they had before ſecretly cauſed to be ſuſpected, and who had neither glory in his War, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or quiet in his Peace) from his General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and with him alſo the other Leaders that were favourers of the Presbytery, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it was not fit that any Members of Parliament ſhould be encouraged to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the War, by enjoying the profitable and powerful Offices in the Army, to which they would now give a new <hi>Module.</hi> Having by this Artifice diſplaced thoſe whoſe Power they feared, they brought in as many Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates of their own Sect as they could to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was appointed General. This Man both Parties did the more eaſily conſent in, becauſe he was known to be of ſufficient Perſonal Valour, and of no private Deſigns, obſtinate by a natural Melancholy, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than pertinacious in any Intereſt, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from Baſeneſs, than ambitious of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory; by all theſe Qualities they ſuppoſed he would be obedient to the Reſolves of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But the <hi>Independents,</hi> that were better informed of his ductile Spirit, and how eaſily he might be impoſed upon by a <hi>Species</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, got the great Patron of all the wildeſt and moſt unreaſonable Sectaries, <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> at firſt to be admitted into his Counſels, and afterwards to be the Director of all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under the title of Lieutenant General. For
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104649:71"/>although he likewiſe by the Self-denying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was made incapable of any Office in the Army, being a Member of the Parliament; yet thoſe Troops of <hi>Fanaticks</hi> whom he had amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and formerly led under the Command of the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> (both which he had caſt off) were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to refuſe the Conduct of any one but him. He was therefore permitted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as the General deſired, for a time to continue in the Army; but he never left it till he had changed that, ruined the Parliament, and turned out the General, that thus was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his unlawful Power. For this Man, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long time been poor and neceſſitous, the Patrimony that was left him being profuſely ſpent, and nothing remaining but the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Crimes, a bloody and fierce nature, a greedy ſoul full of bold and unjuſt hopes, yet able to conceal them with a profeſſion of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, a contempt of Religion and Friendſhip, yet highly pretending to both, till he had ſmote under the fifth rib thoſe credulous hearts that truſted him; he was fitted for the moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſes, for vexed by a preſſing and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious poverty, he reſolved to indeavour the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtance from ſuch a Condition, though by the greateſt wickedneſs, therefore uſed the Power he had now gotten to overthrow the whole State, and eſtabliſh himſelf in an abſolute and unſupportable <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which <hi>is the common iſſue of aſſaulting a Juſt and Lawful Prince with Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:104649:72"/>With theſe Tragedies and Changes was the Winter ſpent at <hi>London,</hi> while the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> waits for the Iſſue of the Treaty at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which, as all other Conſultations for Peace, was vain and fruitleſs. For the Faction would alwayes obſtruct thoſe endeavours by their proper Methods. If the Condition of their affairs were proſperous, then would they make their Demands like Impoſitions on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Slaves, deteſting to ſupplicate that the acquiſitions of their Swords and Blood ſhould be confirmed by a worſted Enemy. In a more humble fortune they would deprecate their drooping Party, <hi>not then to think of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation which their unproſperous Arms muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily render harder than their hopes; and that it was not for the Honour of a Parliament to ſeem to yield to any thing by fear or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Beſides theſe devices, many fictitious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were compoſed, falſe Rumours divulged, and witneſſes ſuborned, to make men ſuſpect that many dangerous Plots and portentous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were diſguiſed in theſe Overtures of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Therefore the Commiſſioners of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were inſtructed to offer no Expedient for an Accommodation, nor hearken to ſuch as were tendred to them in the Name of the <hi>King.</hi> His Majeſty ſeeing and bewailing his Condition, that He muſt ſtill have to do with thoſe that were Enemies to Peace, prepares Himſelf for the War at the approaching Spring: and although
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104649:72"/>this Winter was infamous with many loſſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the neglects or perfidiouſneſs of ſome Officers; yet before the ſeaſon for taking the field was come, His Counſels and Diligence had repaired thoſe damages.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1645.] In <hi>April</hi> He ſends the <hi>Prince</hi> to perfect the Weſtern Aſſociation, and raiſe ſuch Forces as the neceſſities of the Crown, which was His Inheritance, did require: with Him is ſent, as Moderator of His Youth, and prime Counſellour, Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> now Lord <hi>High Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had endeared him to His Majeſty, who alſo judged his Abilities equal to the Charge; in which He continued with the ſame Faith, through all the Difficulties and Perſecutions of his Maſter, till it pleaſed God to bring the <hi>Prince</hi> back to the Throne of His Fathers, and him to the Chief Miniſtery of State. After their departure the <hi>King</hi> draws out His Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve His Northern Counties and Garriſons. But being on His march, and having ſtormed and taken <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in His way, He was called back to ſecure <hi>Oxford,</hi> which the Parliament Army threatned with a Siege. But <hi>Fairfax</hi> having gotten a Letter of the Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s (whom a Parliament Spy had cajoled to truſt him with the delivery of it) to His Majeſty, wherein he had deſired Him <hi>to forbear ingaging with the Enemy, till he could be joyned with Him;</hi> he leaves <hi>Oxford,</hi> and made directly towards the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104649:73"/>
               <hi>King</hi> that was now come back as far as <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> with a purpoſe to fight Him before that addition of ſtrength, and at a place near <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> both Armies met on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, <hi>June</hi> 14. <hi>Cromwell</hi> having then alſo brought ſome freſh Horſe to <hi>Fairfax;</hi> whoſe abſence from the Army at that time the <hi>King</hi> was aſſured by ſome (who intended to betray Him) ſhould be effected. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>King</hi> would not decline the Battel, and had the better at firſt, but His vanquiſhing Horſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the chaſe of their Enemies too far (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal errour that had been twice before commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) left the Foot open to the other wing, who preſſing hotly upon them, put them to an open rout, and ſo became Maſters of His Canon, Camp, and Carriage, and among theſe, of His Majeſties Cabinet, in which they found many of His Letters, moſt of them written to the <hi>Queen:</hi> which, not contented with their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over His Forces, they Print, as a Trophee over His Fame, that by propoſing His ſecret Thoughts, deſigned only for the breaſt of His Wife, to the debauched multitude, and they looking on them through the Prejudices which the Slanders of the Faction had already formed in their minds, the Popular hatred might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. But the publication of them found a contrary effect, every one that was not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous abhorred that Inhumanity among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which Generous Heathens ſcorned to be guilty of, and the Letters did diſcover, that the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104649:73"/>
               <hi>King</hi> was not as He was hitherto characterized; but that He had all the Abilities and Affections, as well as all the Rights, that were fit for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: and (which is not uſual) He grew greater in Honour by this Defeat, though He never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recovered any conſiderable power.</p>
            <p>For the Fate of this Battel had an inauſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence upon all His remaining Forces, and every day His loſſes were repeated. But though Fortune had left the <hi>King,</hi> yet had not His Valour; therefore gathering up the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remains of His broken Army, He marches up and down to encourage thoſe whoſe Faith changed not with His Condition. At laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to relieve <hi>Cheſter,</hi> though He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet behind and before, and His Horſe wearied in ſuch tedious and reſtleſs Marches, yet at firſt He beat <hi>Poyntz</hi> off that followed; but being charged by Freſh Souldiers from the Leaguer, and a greater Number, He was forced to retreat, and leave ſome of His gallant Followers dead upon the place. After this He draws towards the North-Eaſt, and commands the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> with the Horſe that were leſt to march for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there to joyn with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who with an inconſiderable company of men had got Victories there ſo prodigious that they looked like Miracles. But this Lord was ſurpriſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could get out of <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> for His Horſe having taken 700 of the Enemies Foot, were ſo wanton with their Succeſs, that they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104649:74"/>were eaſily maſtered by another Party, and he himſelf was compelled to fly into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe ſeveral Overthrows brought another miſchief along with it; for the <hi>King</hi>'s Commanders and Officers broke their own <hi>Peace and Agreement,</hi> which <hi>is the only Comfort and Relief of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and which makes them conſiderable, though they are deſpoiled of arms,</hi> by imputing (as it uſeth to be in unhappy counſels) the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous part of their misfortunes to one another. But many gallant Perſons, whom Loyalty and Religion had drawn to His Service, endured the utmoſt hazards before they delivered the Holds He had committed to their truſt; and by that means employing the Enemies Arms, gave the <hi>King</hi> time, who was at laſt returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to provide for His Safety.</p>
            <p>Hither every day ſad Meſſages of Ruines from every part of the Nation came, which though they ſeemed like the falling pieces of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved world, yet they found His Spirit erect and undaunted. For He was equal in all the Offices of His Life, tenacious of Truth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and not moveable from them by Fears, a Contemner of worldly Glory, and deſirous of Empire for no other reaſon, but becauſe He ſaw theſe Kingdoms muſt be ruined, when He relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the care of them. But that which moſt troubled Him were the Importunities of His own diſconſolate Party to ſeek for Conditions of Peace, which He ſaw was in vain to expect
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104649:74"/>would be ſuch as were fit to accept; for His former experience aſſured Him, that theſe men would follow the Counſels of their Fortune, and be more Inſolent now than ever. And for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, He was reſolved not to ſacrifice His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Safety, nor His Honour to Life. This He often told thoſe that thus preſſed Him, and did profeſs in His Letter to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> (who likewiſe moved Him to the ſame,) that <hi>He would yield to no more now than what He had offered at</hi> Uxbridge, though He confeſſed <hi>it were as great a Miracle His Enemies ſhould hearken to ſo much Reaſon, as that He ſhould be reſtored within a Month to the ſame Condition He was in immediately before the Battel at</hi> Naſeby.</p>
            <p>But yet to ſatisfie every One how tender He was of the Common Safety, He ſent ſeveral Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the Parliament for a Treaty, and offers to come Himſelf to <hi>London,</hi> if He may have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for Himſelf and Attendants. All which were either not regarded, or anſwered with Reproaches. And becauſe the people began to murmur at ſo great an earneſtneſs of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to continue the Wounds of the Nation open and bleeding, (ſince there were many Forts yet held out for the <hi>King</hi> by Gallant Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had an Army yet unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Montroſs</hi> had conſiderable Intereſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> all which might be perſwaded in a Treaty to part with thoſe Arms which could not be taken from them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104649:75"/>without much blood;) and it was the common belief that theſe men ſought for Victory, not Peace and Liberty, which was now tendred: therefore to raiſe ſuſpicions in the Vulgar, it is ſuggeſted that the Cavaliers who came to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound would take the advantage of the <hi>King</hi>'s Preſence, if He were permitted to be there, and kindle a new flame and War in the City. And that it might be thought they had real grounds for theſe fears, the Diſarmed Compounders were commanded to depart above twenty miles from <hi>London;</hi> and to injealous the people more, all the tranſactions of the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were publiſhed, and amplified with the malicious Slanders and Comments of the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and conſcious Demagogues, that ſo the terrors of the Vulgar being augmented, they might be frighted into a longer patience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> finding theſe men irreconcileable to Peace, and that they had declared againſt His Coming, though without a Caution, tryes the Leaders of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; but they proved no leſs pertinacious, and were now approaching to beſiege <hi>Oxford.</hi> Providence not leaving any more Choice, but only ſhewing Him a way for a preſent Eſcape, He goes in a <hi>Diſguiſe (which when Neceſſity cloathes Royal Perſons with, ſeems like an Ominous Cloud before the Setting of the Sun,)</hi> to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Camp that was now before <hi>Newark,</hi> where the Ambaſſadour of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was then in the Leaguer,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104649:75"/>had before covenanted for His Majeſtie's Safety and Protection; and the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Officers had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <hi>to ſecure both Him and as many of His Party as ſhould ſeek for Shelter with them, and to ſtand to Him with their Lives and Fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1646.] The <hi>King</hi> being come thither <hi>May</hi> 4. made a great alteration in affairs; <hi>Newark</hi> was ſurrendred by the <hi>King</hi>'s Command, and Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> having gallantly defended <hi>Oxford</hi> till the beſiegers offered honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, delivered up that alſo. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Change of Counſels were at <hi>London,</hi> where when it was related, among whom the <hi>King</hi> had ſought a Sanctuary, various and different Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were raiſed. <q>Some wondred that His Majeſty had ſought a Refuge there where the Storm began, and how He could apprehend to find Relief from thoſe that were not only the Authors of His Troubles, but now the great Advancers of His Overthrow: And they conceived <hi>no Promiſes or Oaths can be a ſufficient Caution from thoſe People that have been often Perſidious.</hi> Others judged that in thoſe neceſſities wherein the <hi>King</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it was as dangerous not to truſt as to be deceived; no Counſel could be better, than to try whether a Confidence in them would make them faithful, and whether they would then be honeſt, when they had the Critical Opportunity to teſtifie to the world, that they intended not what they did, but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104649:76"/>what they ſaid; <hi>That they fought not againſt Him, but for Him.</hi> But a laſt ſort bewailed both the greatneſs of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dangers, that ſhould make Him ſeek for Safety in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Sea and falſe bottom; as alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries of the Engliſh <hi>Genius,</hi> which was now ſo corrupted, that their Prince was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſeek an <hi>Aſylum</hi> from their injuries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people that were infamous and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the Blood of many Kings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While others diſcourſed thus of the <hi>King</hi>'s journey, the Parliament heated by the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> fiercely declared againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were removing the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and uſed ſeveral methods to make them odious and drive them home. For they kept back their Pay, that they might exact Free-Quarter from the Country; then they did extenuate their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, derogate from their famed Valour, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them as Mercenaries, threaten to force them out by the Sword. All which while the Engliſh <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> though they wiſh'd well to their Brethren, yet leſt they ſhould ſeem to indulge the Inſolencies of a ſtrange Nation, did not dare to plead in their defence. But the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves for a time did juſtifie their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Preſervation of His Majeſty <hi>by the Laws of Nature, Nations, and Hoſpitality, which forbid the delivery and betraying of thoſe that have fled to any for Succour.</hi> The Democratick Faction urged that it <hi>was not lawful for the</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:104649:76"/>Scots, <hi>their Hirelings, and in their Dominion, to receive the</hi> King <hi>into their Camp without the leave of their Maſters, and keep Him without their Conſent.</hi> Theſe Debates were uſed to raiſe the <hi>King</hi>'s price. Which when the <hi>Scots</hi> were almoſt aſſured of, to make their ware more valuable, they ſolicite the <hi>King,</hi> in hopes of their Defence, to command <hi>Montroſs</hi> to depart from his noble Undertakings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he had almoſt recovered the Overthrow <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> and <hi>Traquaire</hi> had betrayed him unto, and was become formidable again; as alſo the Loyal Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> to deſiſt from his gallant Oppoſitions both of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces. Which when the <hi>King</hi> had done, being not willing thoſe Gallant Perſons ſhould longer Hazard their brave Lives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both theſe Excellent Leaders had more in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than fear parted with their unhappy Arms: that they might have a colour of betraying Him, whom the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which uſeth to hatch all the Seditions to the heat and ſtrength of a ſeeming Authority) had forbid to be brought into <hi>His Native and Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (as He affectionately call'd it) they tender Him the Covenant; pretending without that Chain upon Him, they did not dare to lead Him into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This His Majeſty refuſed not, if they would firſt looſe thoſe Scruples of Church-Government which lay upon His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Therefore to untie thoſe Knots, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Henderſon,</hi> that was then the Oracle of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104649:77"/>Kirk, and the great Apoſtle of the Solemn <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> was employed to converſe with Him. But the Greatneſs of the <hi>King</hi>'s Parts, and the Goodneſs of His Cauſe made all his attempts void (for the Papers being publiſhed, every one yielded the Victory to His Majeſty) and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; for he returned home, and not long after died, as ſome reported, of a Grief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the ſenſe of his Injuries to a Prince whom he had found ſo Excellent.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were acting at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the bargain was ſtroke at <hi>London,</hi> and for 200000 l. His Majeſty, ſtripp'd of thoſe Arms He had when He came among them, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, as it were, to be ſcourged and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſome Commiſſioners from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But to Honeſt their Perfidiouſneſs, they add this Caution, <hi>That there ſhould be no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made upon the</hi> King's <hi>Perſon, but being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at one of His own Palaces, He ſhould there be treated with upon Propoſitions from both Nations, which ſhould ſpeedily be ſent to Him.</hi> But the Parliament never thought of ſending any Propoſitions till He came under the Power of the Army, who had malicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon His Perſon. The Commiſſioners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Him, convey Him to His own Houſe at <hi>Holmeby.</hi> This was a very curious and ſtately Building yet was not therefore choſen becauſe it might be a Majeſtick Priſon; but becauſe it was within Ken of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> which was infamous
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104649:77"/>with His Overthrow, that ſo the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to it might more afflict His grieved Spirit. To this unpleaſingneſs of the Place they added other diſcomforts, by making the reſtraint ſo ſtrict that they ſuffered none to come near Him, that by owning His Cauſe were aſſured of their Welcome; yea, even His Chaplains (which moſt troubled Him) were debarred from their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. But God ſupplyed this Want by more plentiful Aſſiſtances of His Holy Spirit, and made Him, like the Ancient Patriarchs, both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> (at leaſt for Himſelf:) and here He ſacrificed Praiſes even to that God that hid himſelf, and compoſed thoſe moſt Divine Meditations and Soliloquies that are in His Book, ſpending that time in Converſe with Heaven, which He was not ſuffered to employ with Men in whom He delighted.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi>'s Soul was thus winged above the walls of His Priſon and the Fortune of His Enemies, they that had put an end to the War, yet could not find the way to Peace; for their Souls were unequal to the Victory, and could not temper their Succeſs, the two Sects falling to diſſenſion, and turning all their Arts and arms one againſt another. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the richer and more ſplendid followers, but the <hi>Independents</hi> the moſt fierce, ſubtle, and moſt ſtrongly principled to Confuſion; the firſt was Powerful in the Parliament, but the latter in the Army. After they had a long time practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104649:78"/>on one another the very ſame Methods they had acted againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him in the Parliament (of which there were alwayes ſome Number among them) the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> ſtill gained upon their Oppoſites, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> odious, by Libels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to render their Government Ridiculous and Tyrannical, by putting them upon all the moſt envious Employments, as Reforming the Univerſities, and Sequeſtring Miniſters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Not contented thus to deal with their elder Brethren, by ſpoiling them of their Honour, they proceeded to ſtrip them of the reliques of their armed Power, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing them in Parliament with a Vote to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band all the Souldiers that were not in <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army: then the General turns out thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of Garriſons that were any way incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them. Beſides this, they either corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gifts or frighted ſome of the moſt buſie, yet obnoxious, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> either wholly to come over to them, or be their Inſtruments in diſturbing and revealing the Counſels of that Party; which was done under the Scheme of Moderation, and reconciling the Godly one to another.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1647.] The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at laſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with the daily wounds of their Power, and the diſhonour of their Party, began now to be more afraid of their Stipendiaries than they were of their Sovereign; for they found that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104649:78"/>they loſt all that by the Victory which they ſought by the War: therefore to break the confidence of the <hi>Independents,</hi> and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, they Vote in the Parliament, where they had moſt Voices, <hi>That to eaſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Charges in maintaining the Army,</hi> 12000 <hi>of the Souldiers ſhould be ſent over to</hi> Ireland, <hi>and all the reſt to be disbanded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> 6000 <hi>Horſe,</hi> 2000 <hi>Dragoons, and</hi> 6000 <hi>Foot, who ſhould be diſpoſed in different and diſtant places in the Nation, to prevent any Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> The Commanders and <hi>Independents</hi> ſoon diſcovered the Artifice, that it was not to eaſe the Nation, but weaken them; therefore they employ the Inferiour Officers (being perſons that by diſſimulation and impudence having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed themſelves to much ſpeaking, did at laſt imagine their Vices were Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo were fit to diſquiet the minds of men,) to poſſeſs the common Souldiers <hi>with a fear of Disbanding without their Arrears, or elſe to be ſent into that unquiet Iſland to periſh with hunger and cold, and the ſurpriſes of a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy.</hi> This preſently ſet the Army to Mutiny, which while it was in the Beginnings, the Commanders make ſemblance of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at it, ſeem very buſie to compoſe it; and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to make the Parliament ſecure, calls God to witneſs, that <hi>he was aſſured the Army would at their firſt Command caſt their Arms at their Feet;</hi> and again ſolemnly ſwears, that <hi>he had rather himſelf with his whole Family ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104649:79"/>be conſumed than that the Army ſhould break out into Sedition.</hi> Yet in the mean time he and his Creatures in the Army adminiſter new fuel to the flames of it; and when they had raiſed their Fury to ſuch heat that it was at laſt concocted to a perfect defection from all obedience to the Parliament, they lay aſide their diſguiſes, and poſt from <hi>London</hi> to the Head Quarters, where the Synagogue of Agitators was ſeated, and to whom was committed the management of this Conſpiracy. This Conventicle was made up of two of the moſt unquiet and factious in every Regiment of Foot, and each Troop of Horſe: their buſineſs was to conſult the Intereſts of the whole Army, and when they had moulded their Pretences and Arts to their grand Deſign, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ruder part of it in their Clamours and Injuries, and to corrupt all the Garriſons by Emiſſaries to the ſame enterpriſes. At laſt they extended their Cares to the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and dictate what their pleaſures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which was in both Kingdoms <hi>to eſtabliſh the Power and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People;</hi> for they openly profeſſed an intent for Democracie. And becauſe about an hundred Officers in the Army would not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Sedition, they were by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Adjutators, and the ſecret intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Commanders, caſhiered.</p>
            <p>Thus the Counſels of both Parties being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to overthrow their contrary, each
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104649:79"/>thought the Perſon and Preſence of the <hi>King</hi> would be no vain advantage to their Deſigns, for they would Honeſt their actions with a care of Him: therefore the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had it in Conſultation, to Order Col. <hi>Greves,</hi> who had the Command of the Guard about the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> to remove His Majeſty to <hi>London;</hi> the Intelligence of which coming to the Army by the treachery of a certain Lord, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſend a Body of Horſe to prevent them, and to force Him into their own Quarters. Thus was that Religious Prince made once more the mock of Fortune, and the ſport of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and was drawn from His peaceful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, and Proſpect of Heaven, to behold and converſe with men ſet on Fire of Hell. Theſe, to tempt Him to a Confidence in their integrity, (that they might the more eaſily to His diſgrace ruine Him, and murder Him by His own Conceſſions, if He would be deluded by them) highly <hi>pretend to a Compaſſionate Senſe of His Sufferings, and complain of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Barbarous Impriſoning Him in His own Palaces, wondering they had no more Reverence for Majeſty;</hi> and to beget a belief of this, they <hi>profeſs</hi> (which they would have to be conceived with them was more ſacred than any Oaths) <hi>that they will never part with their Arms till they have made His way to His Throne, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Condition of His Party more tolerable.</hi> Beſides theſe Promiſes and Compaſſions, they permit Him the Miniſtery of His Chaplains in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104649:80"/>the Worſhip of God, (which, it is ſaid, He took with ſo great a Joy, that He almoſt believed Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free and ſafe, it being His moſt heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den while He was the Parliaments Captive) the Commerce of Letters with the <hi>Queen,</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of His own Party, and the Service of His Courtiers; ſome of whom they alſo admitted to their Council of War, mould Propoſitions which they will urge in His behalf, and alter them to the <hi>King</hi>'s Guſt and at His Advice. In their publick Remonſtrances againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Ambition, Injuſtice, Cruelty and Self-mindedneſs of the Parliament, they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliquely, ſometimes plainly, profeſs, that <hi>the King, Queen, and the Royal Family muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to all their Rights, or elſe no hope of a ſolid Peace;</hi> but then they would intermix ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as argued they ſought Reſerves for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious eſcape. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> did among his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents boaſt of his fine Arts, and that by theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences was intended nothing but His Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>By all theſe Impoſtures they prevailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the Hopes or Fears of the <hi>King;</hi> nor did He commit any thing unworthy His former Fortune, and the Greatneſs of His Integrity and Wiſdom, or which any of the Diſagreeing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions could uſe to His reproach. But they found another kind of Succeſs upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for they ſacrificed to the Commands of their Stipendiaries eleven Members of the Houſe of Commons, and ſeven of the Peers, cauſing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104649:80"/>them to forbear ſitting among them, becauſe they had been accuſed by the Army in a very frivolous Charge. <q>All men wondering at the inequality of thoſe mens Spirits, who had ſo furiouſly rejected the Articles of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sovereign againſt five or ſix of their Body, and yet did now ſo tamely yield to the ſlight Cavils and diſlike of their Mercenaries above thrice that Number. They therefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that neither <hi>Religion, Juſtice, or the Love of Liberty, which are alwayes uniform,</hi> but <hi>unworthy Intereſts and corrupt Souls, which vary with fears and hopes,</hi> had been the Principles and firſt Movers of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</q> Beſides this, they were ſo prone to Slavery, that they had gone on to Vote all the luſts of the Army, had not a Tumult (their Arts being now turned upon their own heads,) from <hi>London</hi> ſtopp'd them in their violent ſpeed, and kept the Speaker in his Chair till they had voted more generouſly, <hi>that it was neither for their Honour nor Intereſt to ſatisfie the demands of the Souldiers;</hi> and that <hi>the King ſhould come to</hi> London <hi>to treat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe contrary deſires of the divided Faction, which had joyntly oppreſſed their Sovereign, ſhewed, that <hi>Ill men will more eaſily conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in War, than conſent in Peace;</hi> and that <hi>Combinations in Crimes will conclude in Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, each Party thinking the advantages of the other too great; and that Power is never
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104649:81"/>thought faithfull which is accounted exceſſive.</hi> Therefore both prepare for War. With the 140 Members that ſate in Parliament were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City, and the caſhiered Souldiers and Officers that had ſerved in their pay. With the Army were the Speakers of both Houſes; who had ſled to them with about fifty of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that projected the Change of Government, being either for an Oligarchy or Democracie, yet left ſome of the ſame judgement behind, to betray and diſturb the Counſels at <hi>London.</hi> To theſe did adhere the Neighbouring Counties, who were cajoled by the ſplendid Promiſes of the Army, of <hi>Reſtoring the</hi> King, (which they much boaſted) <hi>Diſſolving the Parliament, and Eſtabliſhing Peace and Government:</hi> and they more willingly credited theſe, becauſe they had conceived an hatred of the Parliament and City both for beginning the War, and now obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace. The Army intitle their attempts <hi>for King and People:</hi> Their Adverſaries, <hi>for bringing the King to His Parliament.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were greedy of that War which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed an eaſie Victory, and made the poor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hope for the Plunder of the City.</p>
            <p>For the advantage was clear on the Army's ſide, which conſiſted of veterane Souldiers, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among themſelves by a long Converſe, and known Commanders: but the force of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was made up of a tumultuary Multitude, gathered under new Leaders, and ſo had no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104649:81"/>confidence; their meetings were full of doubts and fears, none could determine in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, nor in publick Conſult, becauſe they da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not truſt one another; and it was obſerved that thoſe who were moſt treacherous talk'd moſt boldly againſt the Enemy. Therefore in the very beginnings the Parliament and City deſert their Enterpriſe, Treat with, and open their Gates to the Army, who march in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph through <hi>London,</hi> bringing the Speakers and their Fellow-Travellers to their Chairs, ſeize upon the <hi>Tower,</hi> diſmantle the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pull down all the Chains and Poſts of the City, ſend the Lord Mayor and the Chief Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and reduce all the Power of the Nation in Obedience to the Commanders. For <hi>Fairfax</hi> is made General of all the Forces both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Rainsbrough,</hi> a Leveller, and a violent Head of the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, High Admiral. The impeached <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> fled beyond Sea, others of that Sect droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complyed with the Fortune of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and that which grieved good Men moſt, was, <hi>a Publick Thanksgiving</hi> (which <hi>is not to be obſerved but for the happy endeavours of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their vertuous and glorious undertakings for Liberty and Safety,</hi> but now was prophaned for our Slavery and Miſery) to God was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Army, and they were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now at a Feaſt, whom before the City would have forced from their Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:104649:82"/>While theſe things were in Motion, the <hi>King</hi> conſults Heaven for Direction, and his Party modeſtly abſtain from either ſide, thought both to be abhorred, and knew that Party would be the worſt which ſhould overcome. The Army having now the greateſt ſtrengths of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Parliament and City at their obedience, make no mention of their former promiſes to the <hi>King;</hi> only the Adjutators were fierce for breaking that Parliament, and calling another, as they call'd it, <hi>more equal Repreſentative.</hi> But both their Synagogue and the Council of War, being now delivered from fear of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> began to contrive the deſtruction both of the <hi>King</hi> and Monarchy. As for the <hi>King,</hi> whom they had now brought to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, ſome that had before contrived His Death, and to murder Him while He was in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Camp, (ſo at once to ſatisfie their own Revenge, and Load their Enemies with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of the Murder,) yet could not then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, were now fiercefor a ſpeedy and ſecret Aſſaſſination by Piſtol or Poiſon. Others would have Him tryed and condemned by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War. But the Chiefs thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more artiſicially in their Crime, and when they ſhould get more Authority, deſtroy Him by a Parliamentary way of Juſtice. To bring this about, they muſt proceed to make Him more odious, that the People might be patient while they kill Him, and undo them. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104649:82"/>therefore to their Impiety, <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Creatures ſtickle fiercely in the Houſe of Commons, and cauſe the Parliament to ſend, not Conditions of Peace to be treated on, but Propoſitions like Commands that admitted no diſpute: which if the <hi>King</hi> had yielded unto, He had deſpoiled Himſelf of Majeſty, and been thought guilty of ſo much want of Spirit as would conclude an unfitneſs for Empire; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch a voluntary Diminution would have been equally unſafe, as unglorious: And if He did not, then He was to be eſteemed the only Obſtacle of the Univerſal Peace. And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould put them to more tedious Arts by ſigning them, they themſelves to divert Him privately procure more ſoft Articles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be ſorry the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sowreneſs and Rigour did yet leaven the Houſe, which made theſe Propoſitions ſo unpleaſant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> could not but perceive the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Army, yet being reſolved that no Dangers whatſoever ſhould make Him ſatisfie thoſe unreaſonable Demands of the Parliament, which granted would have been the heavieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on His Subjects, and the greateſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to His Poſterity He could poſſibly be guilty of; For <hi>to good Princes the Safety of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their own Memory, which is built upon the Happineſs of Poſterity through their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, are more pretious than Life and Power;</hi> and although Providence, and the Malice of His
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104649:83"/>Enemies had obſtructed His way to Glory by Victories and Succeſs, yet He would trace it in the unenvied and unqueſtionable paths of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Juſtice: Therefore to make His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of them advantageous to Himſelf, by a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confidence in the Army's profers, thereby to oblige, if it were poſſible, thoſe that had no ſenſe either of Faith or Honour, or at leaſt, to injealous thoſe two Rivals for His Power, and commit them, the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely rejects the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Propoſitions, and requires the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Army as more equal, and fit for a Perſonal Treaty, and that the Army alſo ſhould nominate Commiſſioners. Cromwell</hi> and His Complices ſeemed to be joyful for this Anſwer of His Majeſty, which had preferred them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Competitors to the Honour of Juſtice and Moderation in the Eyes of the People; but yet ſecretly did they exaſperate the minds of the more ſhort-ſighted Commons againſt the <hi>King</hi> for this Affront. And to the <hi>King</hi> they profeſs a ſhame and trouble upon their Spirits (for ſo they loved to ſpeak) that they could not now perform their Promiſes: ſometimes they excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves by a Reverence to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at other times by the fierceneſs of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutators; and when by theſe excuſes they had coloured their delayes to ſome length, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to interpret their ſayings otherwiſe than the <hi>King</hi> apprehended them, to forget what they had aſſured Him of, and at laſt openly to refuſe any performance. To all theſe Perfidies they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104649:83"/>add other Frauds, to beget a fear in Him of the Adjutators and the Levellers, who they inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him meditated His Murder, profeſſed they could not for the preſent moderate their bloody and impetuous Conſultations, but when they ſhould recover the loſt Diſcipline of their Army, then they might eaſily and ſpeedily ſatisfie their engagements to Him. To give credit to their words, the Fury of the Adjutators was blown to a more conſpicuous Flame, their Papers were publiſhed for a change of Government, call'd <hi>The Caſe of the Army,</hi> and, <hi>The Agreement of the People;</hi> the animations of <hi>Peters,</hi> and another of the ſame Diabolical ſpirit, ſaying, <hi>His Majeſty was but a dead Dog,</hi> were divulged, and all were communicated to ſome Attendants about the <hi>King,</hi> with an Advice from the Chiefs of the Army to eſcape for His Life: for they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing He ſhould be killed while they helpleſly look'd on.</p>
            <p>The fury and threatnings of men of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and bloody Principles, who accounted <hi>all things lawfull that they could do,</hi> that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence adminiſtring Opportunity did invite and licence their impieties,</hi> and <hi>who imputed all their luſts, that had no colour from Juſtice, to the Perſwaſions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> were not to be deſpiſed; nor was the <hi>King</hi> to abandon His Life, if He could without ſin preſerve it to a longer waiting upon God. Therefore with three of His moſt truſted Attendants, in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104649:84"/>dark, tempeſtuous and ominous night of <hi>Novem.</hi> 11. He leaves <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, ſome ſay, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where to ſeek ſafety; others, that He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take Ship, but being diſappointed in His Expectation, He was at laſt fatally led into the Power, and, when He could not eſcape, committed Himſelf to the Loyalty and Honour of Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi> (a Confident of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s, who had been but a little before made Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> for this very purpoſe,) and was by him conveyed to <hi>Carisbrook</hi>-Caſtle, the very Pit His Enemies had deſigned for Him. For it was diſcourſed in the Army above a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before, that the <hi>King</hi> e're long would be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight:</hi> and the very night He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, the Centinels were withdrawn from their uſual Poſts, on purpoſe to facilitate His flight. The all-wiſe God not permitting Him to fly from thoſe greater Trials, and more Glorious Acts of Patience He had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Him. Being here in this falſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, He minds that buſineſs which lay moſt on His Heart, the Settlement of the Nation; He ſends Conceſſions to the Parliament more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and eaſie than they could deſire or hope, together with His Reaſons why He could not aſſent to their Demands; and earneſtly ſolicites them to pity the Languiſhing Kingdom, and come to a Perſonal Treaty with Him, on His Conceſſions and the Army's Demands.</p>
            <p>But the Conſpirators, to cut off all hopes of a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104649:84"/>Treaty, take this Occaſion to ſend four Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Articles, which if He would paſs as Acts, they would treat of the reſt. Theſe were ſo unjuſt, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners in the Name of their Kingdom declare againſt them in publick Writings, and following the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Parliament to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> do in the preſence of His Majeſty proteſt againſt them as contrary to the Religion, the Crown, and Accords of both Kingdoms. The <hi>King,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His wonted Wiſdom and Greatneſs of Mind, preſently returns them an Anſwer, to ſhew the Injuſtice of having Him grant the chief things before the Treaty, which ſhould be the Subject of it, and to give them ſuch an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, to the ruine of all the People. This Anſwer He delivered ſealed to their Meſſengers, who deſired that they might hear it read, and that they might be dealt with as Commiſſioners, not as bare Carriers (a greater truſt than which their Maſters had not committed unto them) and promiſe upon their Honour that it ſhould not be any prejudice to Him. But His Majeſty had no ſooner read it, than they finding it not to the Guſt of thoſe that ſent them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith they had given, cauſe their Juſt Sovereign to be kept cloſe Priſoner, force away His Chaplains, Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> both which He highly valued for their Integrity, Wiſdom, Piety and Learning, and His other Servants, even thoſe whom the Parliament had placed formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104649:85"/>Him, and in whom His Goodneſs had wrought both an Affection and Admiration of Him, and permit none about Him but ſuch as they hoped would be a Watch upon Him, and whoſe barbarous Souls might trample on His Fortune. Beſides they ſet ſtrict Guards at His Doors and Windows, leſt any Letters might come to Him, or be ſent from Him.</p>
            <p>The like reception His Letter found with the Parliament. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> and His Officers were reſolved to go on with their Deſign, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long uſed the <hi>Adjutators,</hi> as ſerved to frighten the <hi>King</hi> into the Toils they had ſet, they ſoon quiet them, (which was not difficult, being a Company of hot-headed fellows, that could only talk, not form a Counſel or a Party, to endure a Storm,) by executing ſome of their moſt pertinacious Leaders; and being free of that care, applyed their practices wholly to the Deſtruction of His Majeſty. To this purpoſe they mould the Four Votes for <hi>No Addreſſes to the King;</hi> but before they bring them into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, they ſend into their ſeveral Counties about forty or fifty of the principal Members, who they thought would oppoſe them, to raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the Souldiers. Nevertheleſs the firſt of thoſe Votes was conteſted againſt ſo ſtrongly, that the Debates laſted from ten of the Clock in the Morning till ſeven in the Evening; and though they thus wearied the more Honeſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet could it not paſs till the Conſpirators
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104649:85"/>had engaged that no worſe thing ſhould be done to the <hi>King.</hi> The remaining Votes were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in half an hours time, when thoſe of the more ſober Principles were gone forth to refreſh themſelves, and the Conſpirators ſtill kept their Seats. The Houſe of Peers were not ſo haſty in them as the Commons had been, and their Debates vexed the Conſpirators with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, till thoſe who were ſent by the Army to thank the Lower Houſe for their Conſent to theſe Deſires of the Souldiers, did alſo threaten the Upper for their long Deliberations: ſome new Terrors were alſo added, for they quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two of their Regiments at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> under colour of guarding the Parliament, but in truth to work upon the Lords; which had its effect, for many that had the moſt Honourable thoughts in this buſineſs, forſook the Parliament, and then three or four (which often was the fulleſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about thoſe times in that Honſe,) joyn with the Commons in their Votes for no Addreſſes.</p>
            <p>This prodigious Perſidiouſneſs in Parliament and Army, both which had ſo frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and ingaged themſelves by Oaths and Promiſes to preſerve the <hi>King</hi> in His Juſt Rights, fill'd all men with amazement and indignation, to ſee how little they valued their Faith, who pretended ſo high to Religion; therefore each of them were put to ſatisfie the Common Fame. <hi>Cromwell</hi> to ſome would have cover'd this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety with another, that as <hi>He was praying for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104649:86"/>a bleſſing from God on his undertakings, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the</hi> King <hi>to his priſtine Majeſty, his tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth, that he could not ſpeak one word more; which he took as a return of Prayer, and that God had rejected Him from being</hi> King. To others he did impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert, <hi>That it was lawfull to circumvent a wicked man with deceit and frauds.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators in the Parliament ſtrove to honeſt their Proceedings by a Declaration, and aſſign in it for Cauſes of their Perjuries, all the Calumnies that had been raiſed againſt the <hi>King</hi> by His moſt profeſſed Enemies, or from thoſe uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rumours which themſelves had invented, adding and repeating others which had even in the Parliament Houſe been condemned as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, (yet now were uſed as neceſſary Veils for a more execrable Falſhood.) Which infamous Libel they cauſe to be ſent to all the Pariſhes of the Kingdom, to be divulged, ſuppoſing that none did dare to refute their black and moſt malicious Slanders, or that none could publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, becauſe they ſet ſtrict Watches upon all the Printing-Preſſes. They likewiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Curates to read it in their ſeveral Churches, and commend it to the People. And that theſe might the more readily obſerve their Orders, they at the ſame time ſtrictly enjoyn the payment of Tithes, and Vote that the Dean and Chapiter's Lands (which they had deſigned for profane Uſes, and never intended they ſhould be for the Emolument of Church-men) ſhould
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104649:86"/>be ſet apart for Augmentations for their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, pretending a fervent zeal for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, when they did moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it. By their Agents, and the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> with other Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, they ſolicite the unacquainted Rabble to ſign to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Addreſſes to approve what they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, and petition for a ſpeedy progreſs in the Ruine of His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But all theſe their curſed Projects failed, for ſeveral Anſwers to their Defamations were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, One writ by the <hi>King</hi> Himſelf, another by
<note n="*" place="margin">A full Anſwer.</note> Sir <hi>Edward Hyde,</hi> and a third by
<note n="*" place="margin">The Regal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology.</note> Dr. <hi>Bates:</hi> all which proved the Monſtrous Falſhoods of their Paper, and that the Faction were guilty of what they imputed to the <hi>King;</hi> and this with ſuch evidence, that none of their moſt mercenary Writers, or the moſt foul-mouthed Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, did dare or hope with Succeſs to reply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The Curates coldly, if at all, obſerved their Orders, and there came ſo few Petitions, and thoſe ſigned by ſuch contemptible and lewd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as they rather loaded the Faction with more hatred, than gave them any credit. While generally in every place none of the People could contain their fury againſt theſe Impoſtors, but publickly curſed them and their Infamous Adherents.</p>
            <p>For their Miſeries made them ſenſible of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104649:87"/>want of that <hi>Prince</hi> whoſe gentle and juſt Rule had brought them to ſuch an inebriating Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, that they had forgot the Miniſter of their Happineſs. But now they found Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it was out of His hand, like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod caſt on the ground, transformed to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and that thoſe who pretended to free them from Tyranny had deluded them into the moſt inſufferable Slavery: wherein they were either totally deſpoiled of all things that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Being comfortable, or they were not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the uſe of them. Religion, the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent, and the Pledge of a future Life, was ſo diſhonoured by Schiſms and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies (fomented to weaken the People by Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to a tameneſs under their Oppreſſors) by Faſts for the moſt impious Deſigns, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for proſperous Crimes; that ſome men concluded it to be nothing elſe but the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tyrants, and the Diſguiſe of Villains, and therefore did forſake it, and turn Atheiſts. Others that did ſtill find the Inward Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, yet feared openly to profeſs it, leſt they ſhould be taken for thoſe that pretended a Love to God, that they might more ſecurely deſtroy men. Liberty alſo was now but an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty name: for all the Common Priſons were too narrow to receive even thoſe that did not dare to break the Laws; ſo that the Houſes of Noble-men were converted to Gaols, for thoſe that were unfortunate in honeſt enterpriſes; where they were to languiſh with want and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104649:87"/>ſickneſs, and not be called to know their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or their Accuſers, becauſe they had not guilt enough for a publick Condemnation. Some were put a Ship-board in the midſt of Summer, there to contract Diſeaſes: Others were ſold Slaves to foreign Plantations. Many to eſcape ſuch naſty Confinements, or an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Torture, fled from their Native Soil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Neighbouring Countries, where they were the Evidences of the Infamy and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſs of our Nation; or ſeeking for Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Iſles and Deſerts of <hi>America,</hi> pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Rocks and Seas with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood.</p>
            <p>Propriety was no longer hedged up by Law; but whom the Violence of the Souldier did not impoveriſh, the frauds of <hi>Committee</hi> men would, from whoſe Rapines none were ſecure that had not been as criminal as themſelves, and few ſafe that did not ſeek their favour, and bow down to their Greatneſs: Theſe men taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the common evils, to ſatisfie either their private revenge, or luſts: for their Proceedings were not regulated by the known Laws; but the ſecret Inſtructions of their Maſters in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Army, or their own Pleaſures, were the Rules of adminiſtring Juſtice. An honeſt Fame likewiſe was a Mark for Ruine: for if any by juſt Arts had got the Eſteem of the People and the Affections of His Neighbourhood, and did not comply with their Intereſt, firſt he was vexed with Slanders and Reproaches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104649:88"/>with Sequeſtration; eſpecially if he were a Miniſter: and it was their common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that <hi>an Honeſt Cavalier was the worſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> and <hi>a Cavalier Saint did the moſt hurt;</hi> ſo that both their Vices and Vertues were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated. Common Converſe was dangerous; for they had Informers in every place, and Spies almoſt in every Family of Note: Servants were corrupted to accuſe their Maſters, and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in Religion did injealous and arm the neareſt Relations one againſt another: Men out of a mutual diſtruſt would haſten from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to conſult in private their peculiar Safety, for they knew their Words were obſerved, and their Secrets ſought after. Few Families but had by the Civil War ſome loſs to bewail; ſome mourned over their diſagreeing Members in different Camps, and had cauſe to fear which ſide ſoever proſpered they muſt be miſerable in ſome part.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more Miſeries were more highly embittered by the uncertainty of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: For the Parliament, that had the name of Government, were guilty of all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of a Community, being Slaves to thoſe whoſe intereſt it was to keep us thus miſerable; and if at any time they were free from the yoke of the Army, the two Sects kept them ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, each Party labouring by Votes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to circumvent the other, that they could not mind the Univerſal Benefit. Beſides the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104649:88"/>Power they exerciſed was too much to be well uſed, for they engroſſed the Legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Exerciſe of Juriſdiction. So that they would make Laws according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and execute them according to their Luſt; this day's Vote ſhould contradict the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day's Order, and to morrow we muſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what to day we ſolemnly ſwore to obſerve: ſo that men knew not what to obey, nor where to reſt. Thus all hopes of Liberty and Peace were loſt in the Confinement of the <hi>King,</hi> who only was found able and willing to determine our Miſeries. For His Principles were Uniform, and His Endeavours for a Settlement conſtant; beſides His Adverſities had illuſtrated, if not calcined, His Endowments. For now when He had no Friends, Counſellors, or Secretaries, His Diſcourſes with Commiſſioners upon their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Addreſſes, and His Declarations of His own Injuries, the Nations Slavery, the Injuſtice of His and their Adverſaries, were ſo excellently and prudently managed, that they undeceived the greateſt part, and reconciled many of His bitter Enemies: therefore the whole Nation now panted for a Return to the Obedience of ſuch an ineſtimable Prince.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations cauſed ſeveral attempts for His Deliverance, ſome Private, and others more Publick. The firſt was managed by thoſe Servants whom the Parliament had placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Him; for theſe won by His Goodneſs, of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104649:89"/>which they were daily witneſſes, twice plotted His Eſcape, and ventured their Lives for His Liberty, but failed in both deſigns: and the laſt being diſcovered before it could be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, One <hi>Rolfe,</hi> a bloody Villain, (that had alſo endeavoured to poiſon Him, for which though he was publickly accuſed, yet was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by that Judge whom the Conſpirators had employed to hear that cauſe) waited to kill Him as He ſhould deſcend from His Chamber.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1648.] The more publick was that of the whole Nation: for inraged with their own Oppreſſions and the Miſeries of their <hi>Prince,</hi> men in moſt Counties, even of thoſe that had adhered to the Parliament, but now vexed that they had been ſo baſely deluded, draw up Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for a <hi>Perſonal Treaty with the</hi> King; <hi>that the Armies Arrears being paid they ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be disbanded; that Relief ſhould be ſent into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and</hi> England <hi>quite eaſed of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, which they could no longer bear.</hi> To theſe Petitions there were ſuch innumerable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, that the Officers of the Army, and Parliament were mad to ſee their Threats of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration, Impriſonment and Death, to make no Impreſſion; and the Promiſes they likewiſe made were ſlighted, becauſe diſcredited by their former Perjuries. The firſt Petitioners were the <hi>Eſſex</hi> men, who came in ſuch Numbers as had not been ſeen before, as if they would force, not intreat for, what was neceſſary. After them
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104649:89"/>thoſe of <hi>Surrey,</hi> whom, by the command of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Parliament-men, the Souldiers aſſault at the Parliament-Doors, kill ſome, wound more, and plunder all: and for this brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit upon unarmed Petitioners, they have the Thanks of the Commons, and a Largeſs for their Valour; that ſo the People might be affrighted from offering Petitions, which before the very ſame men had declared to be <hi>the Birth-right of every Engliſh-man.</hi> 
               <q>While men ſee and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Returns of the Divine Juſtice, and the reciprocal motions of the Popular heat, that the very ſame Parliament that firſt ſtirr'd up this way of tumultuary Petitions againſt the <hi>King,</hi> now complained that the Honour and Safety of Parliaments was indangered by Petitious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all their Tyranny upon the complaining Nation prevailed nothing but to provoke them to a higher Indignation and more frequent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. And when they perceived they dealt with men obſtinate to their own Intereſts, which were not to be gained but by the Publick ruine, they fly from Prayers to Arms, and intitle their juſt War, <hi>For the Liberty of King and People.</hi> And in ſeveral places, as in <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cornwall, York-ſhire, Wales,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Surrey,</hi> multitudes take Arms for this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cauſe. The Navy alſo fall off, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Rainsbrough</hi> their levelling Admiral on Shore, ſeventeen Ships deliver themſelves up to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104649:90"/>the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> likewiſe by an Order of their own Parliament ſend into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (to recover the Liberty and Majeſty of the <hi>King</hi>) an Army under <hi>Hamilton.</hi> But all was in vain, God had decreed other Triumphs for His Majeſty, and to tranſlate Him to another Kingdom. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being but tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily raiſed, having no train of Artillery or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition conſiderable, were ſoon ſuppreſt by a veterane Army provided with all neceſſaries. The <hi>Scots,</hi> either through weakneſs or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Commanders, who made ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly a march that their Van and Rear were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles aſunder, were eaſily worſted by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> who ſurpriſed their main Body, and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> was taken Priſoner. <hi>Cromwell</hi> follows the ſcattered Parties into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were likewiſe aſſaulted by <hi>Argyle,</hi> a domeſtick Enemy, and forced to ſubmit thoſe Arms the Parliament had put into their hands to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that falſe Earl; who calls another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, from which all were excluded that in the former Voted for the <hi>King</hi>'s Delivery, and all the Orders of that Convention made void. <hi>Cromwell</hi> had the Publick Thanks, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Faith of <hi>Argyle</hi> to endeavour, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity permitted, the extirpation of Monarchy out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Navy alſo deſerts the <hi>Prince,</hi> being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this Service; and when he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104649:90"/>bought off their Faith to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Prince,</hi> himſelf was ignominiouſly caſhiered by the Conſpirators. Theſe great diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and overthrows of juſt Enterpriſes men variouſly attributed to different Cauſes. <q>Some to the Perfidiouſneſs, others to the Weakneſs of thoſe that managed them; as alſo to the Treachery of ſome <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Army firſt incouraged, and then in Jealouſie of the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> baſely deſerted them. For the <hi>Rabbies</hi> of the <hi>Kirk</hi> curſed <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the beginning of his Enterpriſe. Another ſort thought them unhappy, becauſe the greateſt part of the Undertakers were ſuch that formerly had either fought againſt the <hi>King,</hi> or elſe had betrayed Him, and God would not now bleſs their unexpiated Arms. And ſome to the Fate of the Kingdom, which God had decreed to give over to numerous and impious Tyrants, becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs and impatience under ſo Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But while theſe things were managed by the Army that were now at a diſtance, and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Terrors were greater in <hi>Scotland</hi> than here, the leſs guilty Parliament-men ſeriouſly conſidering how impatient the People (who in <hi>London</hi> and other places had gotten innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſcriptions to a Petition for a Perſonal Treaty) now were of thoſe Injuries that were done to their Sovereign, how hateful themſelves
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104649:91"/>grew, becauſe they had betrayed and inſlaved their own Privileges, together with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject to an inſatiable and Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Army, and how an evident Ruine attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even their Conqueſts of Him whom it was unlawful to aſſault, did at laſt (though too late) contrary to the clamours of their Factious and Democratick Members, Repeal thoſe Votes which they had formerly made, of <hi>No more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> This being paſſed in both Houſes, they afterwards with a ſtrong Conſent Vote a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Honour, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Safety.</hi> The Factious Party in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament found themſelves too few and weak to oppoſe this impetuous tendency of the Two Houſes and the whole Kingdom to Peace. But yet they endeavoured to fruſtrate the labours of their more ſincere Members, and to baſſle the People's juſt deſires of it, by impoſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unequal Conditions, and obſtructive reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>For they procured that the Treaty ſhould be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and not at <hi>London;</hi> that it ſhould be by Commiſſioners, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with the two Houſes, as was Petitioned. The Propoſitions that were ſent to be Treated were the ſame which had before been offered to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and were then rejected by Him, and alſo condemned by the Army it ſelf as too unjuſt. The Commiſſioners were ſo ſtreightned in Power, that it was not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104649:91"/>lawful for them to ſoften any one of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace, not to alter the Preface, or change the Order of the Propoſitions, nor to debate a Subſequent till the Precedent were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on. They could conclude nothing; they were only to propoſe the Demands, urge Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Royal Aſſent, receive the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer, and refer all in writing to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe ſlow Reſolves, and the delays of ſending were ſuppoſed would conſume that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row meaſure of time which was appointed to debate ſo many and ſo different things, for they were limited to forty days. The Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they ſent, were Five of the <hi>Lord's Houſe</hi> and Twelve of the <hi>Commoners,</hi> and with them ſome of their <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who were to preſs importunately for their Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to clude the <hi>King</hi>'s Arguments for Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, and only to impoſe, not to diſpute, their own.</p>
            <p>With all theſe, upon ſo many ſeveral and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Propoſitions, ſome relating to the Law of the Land, others to Reaſon of State, and ſome to the practice of the Apoſtolical Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches, the <hi>King</hi> was to deal without publick aſſiſtance. For though He was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miniſtry of ſome Officers of State, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours and Divines, yet were they but of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advice, and to ſtand behind the Curtain; He only Himſelf was to ſpeak in the Debate, and ſingly to manage matters of Policy with their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104649:92"/>moſt exerciſed Statiſts, and the points of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with their beſt-ſtudied Divines. <q>The Vulgar, to whom the Arts of theſe men were not ſo obvious, were much pleaſed with the Name of a Treaty, and now hoped to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their Servitude under ſo many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Tyrants, for the moderate and eaſie Government of one Lawful <hi>King.</hi> Others that had a clearer inſight, and obſerved with what difficulties it was burthened, hoped for no benefit from it. Becauſe that if His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould I not Conſent, as they believed He would not, then He would be the object of the popular impatience: And if He ſhould Conſent, He that now was thought to be moſt injuriouſly dealt with, would then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not to deſerve the Pity even of His Friends; nor could He gain any other thing by His Conceſſions, than to be ruined with more Diſhonour. So that conſidering both the inviolable Integrity of His Majeſty, and the implacable Malice of His Enemies, they deſpaired of any happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But beyond the Faith of theſe men, and the Hopes of the other, the <hi>King</hi>'s incredible Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had found Temperaments for their moſt harſh Propoſitions. And by a preſent Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and commanding Eloquence did ſo urge His own, and refell their Arguments, that He forced an Admiration of Himſelf, and, which was a Teſtimony of the Divine Aſſiſtance, drew
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104649:92"/>many of the unwilling Commiſſioners to His own Opinion (though their Commiſſion, and the danger of their Lives, neceſſitated them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the dictates of their own Conſciences, to prolong the Debates;) with a wonderful Lenity proved their Demands unjuſt, yet grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was not directly againſt His Honour and Conſcience: Thus deveſting Himſelf of His own Rights, He demonſtrated that He had thoſe Affections which might juſtly ſtyle Him <hi>the Father of His Country.</hi> For He indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His own Loſſes to repair the damages of His People. Yet the <hi>King</hi> ſaw by the Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the moſt Powerful of thoſe He Treated with, that they intended nothing leſs than Peace, nor any thing more than His Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which that it might be adequate to their Malice, they would have it accompanied with the damnation of His Soul (as He Himſelf in bitterneſs complained to One of His Servants) preſſing Him to do thoſe things which they themſelves acknowledged ſinful, as the Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Lands. Although His Majeſty was thus ſenſible of their inſatiable thirſt for His Blood, yet becauſe He had paſſed His Royal Word not to ſtir out of that Iſland, He did not hearken to the ſame Servant, who perſwaded Him to provide for His Safety by flight, which He aſſured Him was not difficult, and in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to which He offered to hazard his own blood. But the <hi>King</hi> alwayes thought His Life beueath the Honour of Faithfulneſs, and would
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104649:93"/>not give His Enemies that advantage over His Fame, which their unjuſt Arms and Frauds had gotten upon His Perſon, chuſing rather to endure whatſoever Providence had allotted for Him, than by any approach to Infamy ſeek to protract thoſe dayes which He now began to be weary of: For <hi>that life is no longer deſirable to Just Princes, which their People either cannot or will not preſerve.</hi> And He thought <hi>it more Eligible to die by the Wickedneſs of Others, than to live by His own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Treaty thus proceeded, the Army under the Command of the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> (this laſt was Bold, Subtle, Perfidious and Active in all Deſigns; ſo that his Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing congenial with that of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> had been the cauſe of an Alliance betwixt them, for he had Married one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Daughters, and therefore was left to hover about the General as an evil <hi>Genius,</hi> that he might do nothing contrary to their Impious Deſign,) drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> and quartered within half a days march from the City; that if their Intereſt did require, they might the more ſuddenly oppreſs thoſe who were leſs favourable to their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. The Officers did at firſt publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a great Modeſty, as that <hi>they would quietly ſubmit to the Orders of the Parliament; that they did prefer the Common Peace to their own private Advantages, and ſhould be glad to be diſmiſſed from the toyls of War:</hi> yet in private
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104649:93"/>practiſed an univerſal Confuſion, for mingling Counſels with their Factious Party in the Two Houſes, they ſet up again the Meetings of their Adjutators, framed among themſelves Petitions againſt the Treaty, and to require that all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents without difference (wherein they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Perſon of the <hi>King</hi>) might be brought to Tryal; and by their Emiſſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad drew ſome inconſiderable and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, (by repreſenting large ſpoils in the ſubverſion of Monarchy, and imaginary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by the change of Government,) to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them.</p>
            <p>When they thought theſe practices had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their deſired effect, and they had infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of the Souldiers in the ſeveral Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that more Parties of their Army were gathered to their Quarters about <hi>London; Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> under pretext of a Contraſt betwixt him and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> withdraws himſelf privately to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, where being met by ſome of his Complices in the Parliament, they joyntly frame a Declaration in an imperious and affected Style. Wherein in the name of the Army he malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declaims againſt all Peace with the <hi>King,</hi> and His Reſtitution to the Government: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he impiouſly demands that he may be dealt with as the Grand and Capital Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: with theſe he mingles ſome things to terrifie the Parliament, ſome to pleaſe the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and others to raiſe hopes of Novelty in the Rabble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:104649:94"/>This being prepared, and the Treaty now drawing towards an End (which thoſe of the Faction had prolonged and diſturbed, that the Army might have more time to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and the Commanders having a perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence how all things in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> and in the Parliament did ſtrongly tend to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, they thought it now ſeaſonable to begin their intended Crime. Therefore they ſpeedily call a Council of War, at which met the Colonels, and other inferiour Officers, all men of Mercenary Souls, Seditious, Covetous, and ſo accuſtomed to Diſſimulation, that they ſeemed to be compoſed by nature to frame and colour Impoſtures. They began their Meeting with Prayers and Faſting, pretending to inquire and ſeek the Will of God concerning the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs they had predetermined to act. <hi>This is the conſtant practice of ſuch who would moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely abuſe the Patience of the People, while they commit the moſt horrid Crimes. For not being able to honeſt their Iniquities by any colour of Reaſon, or any Command of the known Will of God, they pretend to a guidance by Revelation and Returns of Prayer.</hi> This Impoſture they had hitherto ſucceſsfully uſed; and the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Rabble of the common Souldiers were drawn to a perſwaſion, that God did counſel all the Deſigns of theſe armed Saints. Thus having prefaced their Villany, <hi>Ireton</hi> produces his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, which being read among them was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104649:94"/>received by the <hi>Souldiers</hi> (who, <hi>through a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in blood, and hopes of Spoil, are uſed to praiſe every thing of their Chiefs, whether good or bad, that tends to diſturbance, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of War,</hi>) with as great an Applauſe as if it had been an Oracle from Heaven; and to make it the more terrible, they ſtyled it the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of the Army,</hi> and order it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Parliament in the name of <hi>the Army and People of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When this Remonſtrance was publiſhed, the minds of men were variouſly affected. Some wondred that perſons of ſo abject a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould dare to endeavour the alteration of an Ancient Government, an attempt ſo far above their fortune; and to deſign againſt the Perſon of their Sovereign, who by the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his former Majeſty, and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Deſcent from ſo many Royal Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, had derived all that challenges the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the People. And they thought the act ſo full of a manifeſt Wickedneſs, that the Contrivers could not really intend the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, but only uſed it as a Mormo to frighten the <hi>King</hi> and Parliament to hearken to their Pretenſions of a leſſer guilt. Others conſidering their former Crimes and Injuries both to <hi>King</hi> and People, and their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemies of the Almighty God, did tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge that their preceding Iniquities had now habituated and temper'd them for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104649:95"/>miſchiefs; and that having proceeded thus far, they would think their Safety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in an accumulation of their Sins. Only they admired that theſe men would diſcredit their ancient Arts of pretending to God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (in which they could not ſo eaſily by every Vulgar judgement be deprehended) by boaſting of the Concurrence of the People, which was too evident a Cheat, for not one in a thouſand through the whole Nation but did abominate their practices. But others more Speculative knew it was <hi>the accuſtomed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Subverters of a lawfull Magiſtracy and Invaders of a Tyranny, firſt to ſeek the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Rabble by high pretences of Liberty and Juſtice, and then to boaſt of it as though they had it, and were entruſted by the People to recover what they preſented to their hopes and deſires;</hi> and that theſe men following the ſame practices would be the greateſt Oppreſſors of thoſe whom they pretended to vindicate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament though hitherto they had been very obſequious to the Army, yet the Members now meeting in greater Numbers than uſually, and preferring the utmoſt hazards to a Compliance with this Remonſtrance, laid it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and fell to debate the <hi>King's Conceſſions</hi> which then lay before them. This free and ſtout Carriage of theirs was much reſented by the Souldiers, who ſtormed at the contempt of thoſe whoſe Grandeur depended upon their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104649:95"/>Arms. And leſt they ſhould miſcarry in their Chief Deſign, and loſe the Sacrifice to their Ambition, they immediately ſent a Party of their Army into the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>King:</hi> theſe laying hold upon Him, with a moſt Inſolent Rudeneſs, not permitting the delay of a Breakfaſt, forced Him from the <hi>Iſland</hi> into <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> an unwholeſome and ſordid place. The other part of their Army they cauſe to march towards <hi>London,</hi> with all the imaginable ſigns of terrour, as if they went to ſack and plunder an Enemies Town. When they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, they were quartered in thoſe Houſes of the <hi>King</hi> and Nobility which were neareſt the Parliament-Houſe, hoping by the greatneſs and nearneſs of the danger, ſo to affright thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who were not ſo wicked as to comply with them, that they ſhould voluntarily withdraw, and hiding themſelves, leave the poſſeſſion to their own ſcanty Party. For then the Violence would ſeem leſs, and give more Authority to their unjuſt Decrees.</p>
            <p>But the honeſt Members were more in love with Juſtice, and therefore not terrified with the Menaces and Clamours of the Souldiers, but as inſpired with ſome unaccuſtomed Courage at this time, and thinking themſelves guarded by the Priviledges of Parliament, with a greater boldneſs than uſually they did upon juſt deſigns, they appear in the Houſe. Where the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> re-aſſuming the conſideration of the <hi>King's
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104649:96"/>Conceſſions,</hi> continued that Debate till paſt Midnight; the Factious Party, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Army ſtill raiſing new Doubts and Scruples, multiplying Cavils, and by tedious harangues waſting the time, that the more Juſt Party, which conſiſted moſt of Gentlemen of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, not accuſtomed to ſuch Watchings and Faſtings, might be wearied out, and leave them to their own Reſolves: and alſo that they might give time to the whole Army to march into the <hi>City</hi> that Night. Among the reſt, Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> (who was born to diſquiet the world, and to be a firebrand of Communities, yet ſtill carrying his deſigns of Confuſion under a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meekneſs and ſimplicity of the Goſpel) This Man in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> had perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> not to be prodigal in His <hi>Conceſſions;</hi> that He had already yielded more than was fit for them to ask, or Him to grant, and undertook to make it evident to the whole world: yet now did moſt fiercely and perfidiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt the <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> as deſigned by the <hi>King</hi> under the ſpecies of Peace to ruine the Parliament and Common-wealth. Yet at laſt, notwithſtanding thoſe Terrours without, and Troubles within, the Houſe came to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that <hi>The Kings Conceſſions were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for Peace.</hi> Which was carried by Two Hundred Voices, and there were ſearce Sixty Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>The next day the ſame Reſolve was paſſed by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104649:96"/>the <hi>Lords</hi> in the very ſame terms, not one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting. Who immediately adjourned for a week, to wait whether this fury of the Army would ſpend it ſelf after ſo generous an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And the Houſe of Commons ſent ſome of their own Members to acquaint the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Officers of this their Vote. This free and publick deteſtation of the Crime, that was deſigned, did extremely enrage the Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of it, and the Democratick Party in the Houſe mingled Threatnings with their Advices. For One of the Chiefs of the Faction could not forbear to aſſure them, that <hi>If they continued in this their Reſolve, they ſhould never after have Liberty of meeting there again.</hi> Which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was executed: for the next day they were to meet there, the Colonels had placed a guard of two Regiments of Foot and one of Horſe upon the Houſe of Commons, who ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keeping all the Avenues thereto, that none might enter without their Licence, laid hold upon Forty Members that were Perſons of the moſt known Integrity and higheſt Reſolution; they denied admiſſion to One hundred and fifty more, and ſuffered none to enter of whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile compliance they were not well aſſured. Some that had eſcaped their obſervation, and got into the Houſe, by tickets, as from Friends or Servants, they invite forth; whom being once without doors they violently force away, while they in vain pleaded the <hi>Privileges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:104649:97"/>The impriſoned Members they vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with great Indignities, expoſing them to the mockeries and inſolencies of the Common Souldiers: although there were among them many that had before Commanded Armies, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades and Regiments in the Parliament's cauſe againſt the <hi>King;</hi> and others that had been moſt importunate aſſertors of their firſt injuſtice to their Prince. <q>Thoſe that beheld theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes wondred, and acknowledged the juſt Judgement of God, that had thus viſibly and properly puniſhed the Injuſtice of theſe men againſt their Lawful Sovereign, by the miniſtry of their own more vile and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Souldiers, and did thus upbraid them with the falſeneſs of their Principles by which they acted againſt the <hi>King;</hi> the very ſame now ſerving to honeſt this violence that was committed on them: for both equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a Neceſſity of Reformation, and Self-preſervation. Others were inquiſitive for the faith of theſe men, who taking up Arms for the Sacred Privileges of Parliament, had now left nothing but the Walls of that Houſe.</q> For the Number that would ſerve them was not equal to the Name of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being ſcarce the eighth part of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and not much above Forty in all, and thoſe the reproach of that Aſſembly. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that were violently excluded, others that did abhor the Conditions of ſitting there
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104649:97"/>withdrew themſelves to their own homes. And many of thoſe who formerly deluded by their pretenſions to Religion, Juſtice and Liberty, had hitherto been of the Faction, yet now awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe clamorous Crimes, ſorſook their bloody Confederacy.</p>
            <p>Yet did not this contemptible Number, of which in moſt Votes there were Twenty Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bluſh to aſſume the Authority of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the weightieſt Aſſairs of the <hi>Engliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> to alter and change the Government, to expoſe His Majeſty to a violent Murder, and to overthrow the Ancient Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. For being wholly devoted to the ſervice of the Army, they communicated counſels with them; and whatſoever was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>Council</hi> of War, paſled into a Law by the Votes of this Infamous Remnant of the Houſe of Commons, who now ſerved the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in hopes of part of the Spoil, and a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> which <hi>being acquired by ſo much Wickedneſs could not be laſting.</hi> In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Army's deſign they revive thoſe Votes of <hi>No Addreſſes to the</hi> King; (which had at firſt but ſurreptitiouſly, and by baſe practices paſſed, and had been afterwards Repealed by a full Houſe.) Thoſe Votes of <hi>a Treaty with the King, and</hi> of the <hi>Satisfactorineſs of His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,</hi> with ſcorn they raſed out of the <hi>Journal</hi>-Book.

               <q>Thoſe that were leſs affected with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fears and Miſeries could not temper their mirth and ſcorn at ſuch ridiculous Uſurpers,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104649:98"/>that thought to adjuſt their Crimes by their own Votes; that in one breath would adorn the People with the Spoils of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and in the next rob the People to inveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

            </p>
            <p>For in their next Conſultations, they Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a <hi>Tribunal</hi> to Sentence their <hi>Sovereign</hi> (which afterwards they uſed as a Shambles for the moſt Loyal and Gallanteſt of the <hi>Nobleſs</hi> and <hi>People</hi>) of the moſt abject Subjects; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Reverence to the Vileſt of men, they give
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104649:99"/>it the ſpecious name of <hi>The High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> For which they appoint One hundred and fifty Judges (that the Number might ſeem to repreſent the whole Multitude) of the moſt violent and heady of all the Faction: To whom they give <hi>a Power of Citing, Hearing, Judging and Puniſhing CHARLES ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ART King of</hi> England. To make up this Number they had named ſix <hi>Peers</hi> of the Upper Houſe, and the twelve <hi>Judges</hi> of the Land. But the greateſt part were Officers of the Army (who having confederated againſt His Majeſty, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required His Blood, could not without a contempt to the light of Reaſon be appointed His Judges) and Members of the Lower Houſe, who were moſt violent againſt Monarchy, and indeed all Government wherein themſelves had no ſhare. The reſt were Perſons pick'd out of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs thereof, who they imagined would be moſt obſequious to their Luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thoſe that ſurveyed the Liſt, and knew the Men, deemed them moſt unfit for a Truſt of Juſtice, and proper Inſtruments for any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed undertaking; for of theſe Judges one or two were <hi>Coblers,</hi> others <hi>Brewers,</hi> one a <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,</hi> and many of them <hi>Mechanicks.</hi> Such among them as were deſcended of Ancient Families, were men of ſo mean worth, that they were only like the <hi>Statues</hi> of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, had nothing but their Names to make
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104649:99"/>them known unto the World. Some of them were <hi>Spend-thrifts, Bankrupts,</hi> (ſuch as could be neither ſafe nor free, unleſs the Kingdom were in Bondage) and moſt notorious <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,</hi> whoſe every Member was infamous with its proper Vice; Vain and Atheiſtical in their Diſcourſe, Cowardly and Baſe in Spirit, Bloody and Cruel in their Counſels, and thoſe Parts that cannot honeſtly be named were moſt diſhoneſt. <hi>One</hi> of them was accuſed of a <hi>Rape; Another</hi> had publiſhed a <hi>Book</hi> of Blaſphemies againſt the <hi>Trinity of the Deity.</hi> Some of them could not hope to get <hi>impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> for their Oppreſſions of the Country and Expilations of the publick Treaſure, but by their Miniſtry to this Murther. Others could not promiſe themſelves an <hi>advancement</hi> of their abject or declining Fortune but by this Iniquity. Yet all theſe by the Faction were inrolled in the Regiſter of Saints, though fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtand as Malefactors at the Bar, than to ſit upon Seats of Judgement. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their diligent ſearch for ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, who would not bluſh at nor fear any guilt, ſome of thoſe whom they had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in abhorrency of the Impiety, refuſed to fit; and ſome that did, yet met there in hopes of diſturbing their Counſels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this while the Houſe of <hi>Peers</hi> were not Conſulted, and it was commonly ſuppoſed that moſt of them terrified with thoſe Preparations
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104649:100"/>againſt the <hi>King (the only defence of the Nobleſs againſt the Popular Envie)</hi> would abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that Houſe, except four or five that were the Darlings of the Faction; and they deemed the Names and Compliance of thoſe ſew were enough to give credit and Authority to their bloody Act. But in them they were diſappointed alſo; for ſome of the <hi>Peers</hi> did conſtantly meet, and on that day wherein the <hi>Bill for Tryal of the King</hi> was carried up to that Houſe, there were Seventeen then preſent (a greater Number than uſual,) who all Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly (even the Democratick Lords not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting) did reject <hi>the Bill as Dangerous and Illegal.</hi> This ſo highly provoked the Fury of the Faction, that they meditated a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and for the preſent blotted out thoſe <hi>Peers,</hi> whoſe Names they had before put into their Ordinance, to make their Court more ſplendid. After this they did alſo raſe out the names of the <hi>Judges of the Land;</hi> for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privately Conſulted concerning theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the <hi>King,</hi> (although they had been all raiſed to that Dignity and Truſt by the Faction, yet) anſwered, that <hi>It was contrary to the known Laws and Cuſtoms of</hi> England, <hi>that the King ſhould be brought to Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To heal theſe two wounds which the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> had branded their Cauſe with, they uſe two other Artifices to keep up the Spirits and Concurrence of their Party. Firſt, they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104649:100"/>bring from <hi>Hert ford ſhire</hi> a Woman (ſome ſay a <hi>Witch</hi>) who ſaid, that <hi>God by a Revelation to her did approve of the Army</hi>'s <hi>Proceedings.</hi> Which Meſſage from Heaven was well accepted of with Thanks, as <hi>being very ſeaſonable, and coming from an humble Spirit.</hi> A ſecond was the <hi>Agreement of the People,</hi> which was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule of a <hi>Democratical</hi> Politie, wherein thoſe whoſe abject Condition had ſet them at a great diſtance from Government, had their hopes raiſed to a ſhare of it, if they conſpired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the great Obſtruction, which was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Life of the <hi>King.</hi> This was preſented to the Houſe of Commons by Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> and ſixteen other Officers, as a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remedy; for when they had perpetrated their Impiety, they diſcountenanced and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſecuted thoſe that endeavoured it.</p>
            <p>In conſidence of theſe their Arts and their preſent Power, notwithſtanding all theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Abhorrencies and deteſtations by all Perſons of Honour and Knowledge, they Enacted their Bill. And for <hi>Preſident</hi> of this Court, they choſe one of the Number, <hi>John Bradſhaw;</hi> 
               <q>A perſon of an equal Infamy with his new employment. A Monſter of Impudence, and a moſt fierce Proſecuter of evil purpoſes.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104649:101"/>more often bribed to be ſilent, than fee'd to maintain a Client's Cauſe. His Vices had made him penurious, and thoſe with his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury had ſeaſoned him for any execrable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</q> They alſo had a <hi>Sollicitor</hi> of the ſame Metal, <hi>John Cooke,</hi> 
               <q>A needy man, who by various Arts, and many Crimes had ſought for a neceſſary Subſiſtence, yet ſtill ſo poor, that he was forced to ſeek the ſhelter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and ſordid corners to avoid the Priſon. So that vexed with a tedious Poverty, he was prevailed upon through the hopes of ſome ſplendid booties to venture on this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at the firſt mention he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to abhor.</q> Theſe were their Chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: other inferiour Miniſters they had equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified with theſe their prime Inſtruments, as <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> a German <hi>Bandito,</hi> who was to draw up the Charge; <hi>Steele,</hi> another of their Counſel, under pretence of ſickneſs covered his fear of the Event, though he did not abhor the wickedneſs of the Enterpriſe, having before uſed his Tongue in a cauſe very unjuſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this, the Murther of Captain <hi>Burleigh.</hi> The <hi>Serjeants, Clerks</hi> and <hi>Cryer</hi> were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, that the world had never taken notice of them, but by their ſubſerviency to this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Publick Preparations; In pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate they continually met to contrive the Form of their Proceedings, and the Matter of their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104649:101"/>Accuſation. Concerning the firſt, they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Opinions. Some would have the <hi>King</hi> firſt formally degraded and deveſted of all His Royal habiliments and Enſignes of Majeſty, and then as a private perſon expoſed to Juſtice. But this ſeemed to require a longer ſpace of time than would comport with their project, which, as all horrid acts, was to be done in a preſent fury, leſt good Counſels might gather ſtrength by their Delay. Others rejected this courſe as too evidently conforming with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure againſt <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> and they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confirm that common Suſpicion, that they followed <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Counſels (whoſe <hi>Society</hi> (it is reported) upon the <hi>King</hi>'s offering to give all poſſible Security againſt the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at a Council of theirs did decree to uſe their whole Intereſt and Power with the Faction to haſten the <hi>King</hi>'s death.) Which ſober <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had reaſon enough to believe, becauſe all or moſt of the Arguments which were uſed by the Aſſertors of this Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on His Majeſty, were but gleanings from <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers. Theſe Conſiderations caſt the Determination on their ſide who, deſigning a Tyrannical <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> whereby they themſelves might have a ſhare in the Government, would have the <hi>King</hi> proceeded againſt as <hi>King,</hi> that by ſo ſhedding His Blood they might extinguiſh Majeſty, and with Him murther Monarchy. For ſeveral of them did confeſs, that indeed He was guilty of no Crime more than that He was their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104649:102"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> and becauſe the Excellency of His Parts, and Eminent Vertues, together with the Rights of His Birth, would not ſuffer Him to be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon.</p>
            <p>In their ſecond Debate about the Matter of Accuſation, all willingly embraced the Advice of <hi>Harriſon</hi> (who was emulous of the Power of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and though now his Creature, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards became the Firebrand and Whirlwind of the following Times) <hi>to blacken Him</hi> as much as they could; yet found they not wherewith to pollute His Name. For their old Scandals which they had amaſſed in their Declaration for no more Addreſſes to the <hi>King,</hi> had been ſo publickly refuted, that they could afford no colour for His Murther. Therefore they form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Accuſation from that War to which they had neceſſitated Him. And their Charge was, that <hi>He had levied War againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that He had appeared in Arms in ſeveral places, and did there proclaim War, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it by killing ſeveral of the Good People; for which they impeached Him as a Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and an implacable Common Enemy.</hi> 
               <q>This Charge, in the Judgement of Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, argued a greater guilt in thoſe that proſecuted it than in Him againſt whom it was formed: for they ſeemed leſs ſenſible of the inſtability and infirmities of humane Nature, than thoſe that had none but her light to make them generous, for ſuch never reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104649:102"/>their conquered Enemies with their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but theſe men would murther their own Prince, againſt whom they had nothing more to object than the unhappy iſſues of a <hi>War,</hi> which <hi>leaves the Conquered the only Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, while the names of Juſtice and Goodneſs are the ſpoils of the Conquerour.</hi> How falſe thoſe Imputations of <hi>Tyranny, Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> were, was ſufficiently underſtood by thoſe who conſidered the peaceful part of the <hi>King</hi>'s Reign; wherein it was judged, that if in any thing He had declined from the ſafeſt Arts of Empire, it was in the neglect of a juſt Severity on Seditious perſons whom the Laws had condemned to die. And in the War it was known how often His Lenity had clipped the wings of Victory. But it appeared that theſe men, as they had broken all Rights of Peace, ſo they would alſo thoſe of Conqueſt, and deſtroy that which their Arms pretended to ſave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How little credit their Accuſation found ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the endeavours of all Parties to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon from Danger, and the Nation from the guilt of His Blood. For while they were thus engaged to perpetrate their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miſchiefs, all Parties declare againſt it. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, almoſt all thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> and very many out of the ſeveral <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and ſome, though few, alſo of the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> did in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

That is was to the diſhonour of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and againſt the publick good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> But all was fruitleſs, for they had loſt their Miniſterial Authority by ſerving the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo long, till they needed not their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and deſpiſed their admonitions: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the very ſame Principles they preached to kindle the War were now beat back into their faces, and made uſe of againſt them to adjuſt the Murther. The People alſo contemned them for their ſhort-ſightedneſs, in that they would be the heady and indiſcreet Inſtruments of ſuch men, and in ſuch practices as muſt of neceſſity at laſt ruine them and all Miniſters, as well as the <hi>King</hi> and Biſhops.</p>

The <hi>States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by their Ambaſſadors (if they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their truſt) did intercede, and deprecate it as moſt deſtructive to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt. Some of the moſt eminent of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104649:103"/>the <hi>Earl of Southampton,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs of Hertford,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Lindſey,</hi> and others, neglect no wayes, either by Prayers or Ranſom, to ſave the <hi>King.</hi> Yea, they offered themſelves, as being the prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the <hi>King</hi>'s Commands, as <hi>Hoſtages</hi> for Him, and if the Conſpirators muſt needs be fed with blood, to ſuffer in His ſtead for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He had done amiſs. The <hi>Prince</hi> piouſly aſſaies all wayes and means to deliver His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the danger.

But all was in vain, for no Conditions of Peace could pleaſe them who were poſſeſſed with unlawful and immoderate deſires: their Ambition (that is more impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all other affections) had ſwallowed the hopes of Empire; therefore they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>King</hi> to enthrone themſelves. Some thought that their deſpair of Pardon had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened them to a greater Inhumanity, for if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe attempts they continued the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, they muſt beg their own; which they knew Juſtice would not, and they reſolved Mercy ſhould not give; for this is reckoned

            <p>The Conſpirators taking heat from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Preachers, whom they themſelves had firſt kindled, and ſomewhat doubting that theſe ſeveral ſtrong Applications from all Parties to ſave the <hi>King,</hi> and the Univerſal Diſcontents, might take ſome advantage from their delay, with more ſpeed haſten the Aſſaſſination. In order to which they ſend a <hi>Serjeant of Arms</hi> with a guard of Horſe (leſt the People ſhould ſtone him for his Employment) into <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,</hi> and other places in <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all that could lay any crime to the</hi> King<hi>'s charge, to come, and give in their evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him.</hi> Having proclaimed their wicked purpoſes, and dreſs'd up a <hi>Tribunal</hi> at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with all the ſhapes

            <p>Into which Scene the <hi>King</hi> enter'd with a generous Miene, ſhewing no ſigns of diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor any thing beneath His former Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; but as if He were to combate for Glory the Monſters of Mankind, He undauntedly took the Seat which was ſet for Him, with ſcorn looking upon the fictitious Judges, and with pity upon the People, who crouding in (the great Gates of the <hi>Hall</hi> being flung open) did bewail in Him the frailty of our Humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whoſe higheſt Greatneſs hath no Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: A ſad Spectacle even to thoſe that were not in danger.</p>
            <p>He being ſet, the Charge againſt Him was read, with all thoſe reproachful terms of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Traitor</hi> and <hi>Murtherer;</hi> after which He was impleaded in the name of the <hi>People of England.</hi> This falſe Slander of the <hi>People of England</hi> was heard with Impatience and Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of all, and ſtoutly atteſted againſt by the Lady <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Wife of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who by this act ſhewed her ſelf worthy of her Extract from the Noble Family of the <hi>Veres;</hi> for from an adjoyning Scaffold where ſhe ſtood,

            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> after the Charge was read, with a countenance full of Majeſty and Gravity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by what Authority they proceeded with Him thus contrary to the Publick Faith, and what Law they had to try Him that was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereign. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> replying, that of the Parliament; His Majeſty ſhewed the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Falſhood in pretending to what they had not, and if they had it, yet it could not juſtifie theſe Practices. To which reply when they could not anſwer, they force Him back to the place of His Captivity.</p>
            <p>The Magnanimity of the <hi>King</hi> in this dayes conteſt with theſe inhumane Butchers, did much ſatisfie the People, and they were glad (while they thought not of His Danger) that He want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not either Speech or Courage againſt ſo powerfull Enemies; that He had ſpoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthy of Himſelf, and had preſerved the Fame of His Vertues even in ſo great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities. For He ſeemed to triumph over their Fortune whoſe Arms He was now ſubject to. The Parricides ſought to break His Spirit by making His appearances frequent before ſuch contemptible Judges, and often expoſing Him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104649:106"/>to the contempt of the armed Rabble; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore four dayes they torture Him with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Reproaches of their Infamous Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor and Preſident. But He ſtill refuſed to own their Authority, which they could not prove lawful, and ſo excellently demonſtrated their abominable Impiety, that He made Col. <hi>Downes,</hi> one of their Court, to boggle at, and diſturb their Proceedings. They therefore at laſt proceeded to take away that Life which was not to be ſeparated from Conſcience and Honour, and pronounced their Sentence of Death upon their Lawful and Juſt Sovereign, <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. not ſuffering Him to ſpeak after the Decree of their Villany, but hurrying Him back to the place of His Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>At His departure He was expoſed to all the Inſolencies and Indignities that a phanatick and baſe Rabble, inſtigated by <hi>Peters</hi> and other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors of Villany,</hi> could invent and commit. And He ſuffer'd many things ſo conformable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> His <hi>King,</hi> as did alleviate the ſenſe of them in Him, and alſo inſtruct Him to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Patience and Charity. When the barbarous Souldiers cryed out at His departure, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, Execution, Execution,</hi> as thoſe deceived <hi>Jews</hi> did once to their <hi>KING, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Him, Crucifie Him;</hi> this <hi>Prince,</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that moſt <hi>Holy King,</hi> pitied their blind fury, and ſaid, <hi>Poor Souls! for a piece of Money they would do as much for their Commanders.</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:104649:106"/>As He paſſed along, ſome in defiance ſpit upon His Garments, and one or two (as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by an Officer of theirs, who was one of their Court, and praiſed it as an evidence of His Souldiers Gallantry, while others were ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified with their prodigious baſeneſs) polluted His Majeſtick Countenance with their unclean ſpittle: the <hi>Good King,</hi> reflecting on His great <hi>Exemplar</hi> and Maſter, wiped it off, ſaying, <hi>My Saviour ſuffer'd far more than this for me.</hi> Into his very face they blowed their ſtinking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, which they knew was very diſtaſtefull to Him; and in the way where He was to go, juſt at His feet, they flung down pieces of their naſty pipes. And as they had deveſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all humanity, ſo were they impatient and furious if any one ſhewed Reverence or Pity to Him as He paſſed. (For <hi>no honeſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit could be ſo forgetful of humane frailty, as not to be troubled at ſuch a ſight; to ſee a Great and Juſt King, the rightful Lord of three flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Kingdoms, now forced from His Throne, and led captive through the ſtreets.</hi>) Such as pull'd off their Hats, or bowed to Him, they beat with their Fiſts and Weapons, and knock'd down one dead but for crying out, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had brought Him to His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, even there they ſuffered Him not to reſt, but thruſting in and ſmoaking their filthy To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, they permitted Him no privacy to <hi>Prayer</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:104649:107"/>and <hi>Meditation.</hi> Thus through variety of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did the <hi>King</hi> paſs this day, and by His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wearied His Tormentors: nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy His former greatneſs of Fortune and Mind by all theſe Affronts was extorted from Him, though <hi>Indignities and Injuries are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual to Princes,</hi> and theſe were ſuch as might have forced paſſion from the beſt-tempered meekneſs, had it not been ſtrengthned with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from Heaven. In the Evening the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators</hi> were acquainted by a Member of the Army, of the <hi>King</hi>'s deſire, that ſeeing His death was nigh, it might be permitted Him to ſee His <hi>Children,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> then Lord <hi>Biſhop of London,</hi> (now <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury</hi>) might be admitted to pray with Him in His private Chamber. The firſt they did not ſcruple at, the Children in their power being but two, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Gloceſter,</hi> and they very young. The ſecond they did not readily grant. Some would have had <hi>Peters</hi> to undertake that employment for which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was ſent for: But he declined it with ſome Scoffs, as knowing that the <hi>King</hi> hated the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſuch an unhallowed Buffoon. So that at laſt they permitted the Biſhops acceſs to the <hi>King,</hi> to whom his eminent Integrity had made him dear. For with ſo wonderful a prudence and uprightneſs he had managed the envious Office of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> that that accuſing age, eſpecially of <hi>Church-men,</hi> found not matter for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104649:107"/>any impeachment, nor ground for the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was removed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where the <hi>Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> read Divine Service, and preached before Him in private on theſe words, <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi> While the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> at this time, and alſo at other times, were performing the <hi>Divine Service,</hi> the rude Souldiers often ruſhed in, and diſturbed their <hi>Offices</hi> with vulgar and baſe Scoffs, vain and frivolous Queſtions. The Commanders likewiſe, and other impertinent <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> did interrupt His Meditations, who came to tempt and try Him, and provoke Him to ſome unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſputations. But He maintained His own Cauſe with ſo irrefragable Arguments, that He put ſome to ſilence, the petulancy of others He neglected, and with a modeſt contempt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their Scoffs and Reproaches. In the narrow ſpace of this one day, and under ſo continued Affronts and Diſturbances, the <hi>King</hi> (whoſe whole Soul was totally compoſed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,) applyed Himſelf, as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to the Reading Holy Scriptures, to Prayer, Confeſſion of Sins, Supplications for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of His Enemies, the receiving the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, holy Conferences, and all the Offices of Piety: ſo under the utmoſt Malice and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of men, He laboured for the Mercy of God,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104649:108"/>and to fit Himſelf for His laſt victory over Death.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus ſpent this day, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in the ſeveral Churches in <hi>London,</hi> and in thoſe parts of the Kingdom where His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was known, were very earneſt in their Prayers to God for His Deliverance and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſſiſtance. <q>Some of them in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons declared the horrour of that ſin that was about to be committed, deteſted the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Parricides, and denounced the heavy Judgements which ſuch a ſinfull Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on polluted with their Prince's blood were to expect. The <hi>Congregations</hi> were diſſolved into Tears. Some bewailed the ſad Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>King,</hi> as the effect of the Sins of the Nation. Others curſed their damnable Credulity of the Slanders of that Juſt Man, and the promiſes of Liberty by their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. And another ſort wept, becauſe their Fears did prognoſticate thoſe Miſeries which the Iſſue of His blood would let in upon them. And every one found matter of grief, fear, and indignation in the loſs of ſo Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Prince. All countenances were full of ſadneſs and aſtoniſhment, there was no Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults nor any Quiet, every one liſtning and hearkning, either as impatient to know the greatneſs of their Miſery, or greedy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome hopes of Comfort in their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's Safety; otherwiſe there was a ſtilneſs
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104649:108"/>like that which too ſtrong Paſſions effect, and might be thought a Stupidity rather than a Calmneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. the <hi>King</hi> was permitted the ſight of His Children. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and words with them was taken in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and communicated to the World by the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> His Daughter, a Lady of moſt eminent Endowments; who though born in the ſupremeſt Fortune, yet lived in continual Tears, the paſſages of her Life being ſpent in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ruines of her Family, and the Murther of her dear Father, whom ſhe not long ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but died in that Confinement to which they had cheated His Majeſty, in <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While theſe things were done in publick, the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> meet in private in a Committee, to appoint every one their part in this Tragedy, determine what Geſtures they were to affect, what Words they were to uſe, as alſo for the manner, place and time of the <hi>Murther.</hi> In which Conſultations, both now and before the Sentence, each one, according to the bloodineſs of his temperament, or ſervilely to flatter <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> by their Cruelty to Him that did obſtruct his Ambition, did propoſe ſeveral wayes either of contempt or hatred in killing their ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet anointed, <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Some would have His Head and Quarters faſtned upon Poles (as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104649:109"/>it is uſual with Traitors) that the marks of their Cruelty might out-laſt His Death. Others would have Him hanged, as they puniſhed Thieves and Murtherers. Others gave their Vote that He ſhould ſuffer in His Royal Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments with His Crown, and in His Robes, that it might be a Triumph of the Peoples power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt they think it ſufficient that He ſhould loſe His Head by the ſtroak of an Axe on a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold near <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gates before the <hi>Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>-Houſe, that ſo from thence where He uſed to ſit on His Throne, and ſhew the Splendour of Majeſty, He might paſs to His Grave; there parting with the Enſigns of Royalty, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them down as Spoils, where He had before uſed them as the Ornaments of Empire. Thus did they endeavour to make their Malice Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and provided Triumphs for their revenge. And becauſe they ſuſpected, or were informed, that as the <hi>King</hi> had not owned their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo He would not ſubmit to their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor willingly ſtoop to the Block, they cauſed to be faſtned in it ſome Iron Staples and Rings, that by them with Cords they might draw Him down, if He would not comply. But His prudent Meekneſs prevented this Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and He died diſowning their Authority, though He could not eſcape their Power.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Preparations, they cauſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104649:109"/>ſome Souldiers to offer to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> certain Articles and Conditions, to which if He would ſubſcribe, they promiſe Life, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a precarious Empire: either out of a Terrour and Fear of the conſequents of their Impieties; for the confidence of contriving great Crimes is often turned into a ſollicitude when they come to be acted: or out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ruine His Conſcience and Honour, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with His mortal Life, if He ſhould conſent. But when one or two of them had been read to Him, He refuſed to hear any more, ſaying, <hi>I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths ere I will ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute my Honour, or betray the Liberties of my People.</hi> Thus mindful of Juſtice, He would not deface the Splendor of His former Vertues with a too impotent deſire of Life.</p>
            <p>At laſt that Fatal Day, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. approached: and that morning, a little before His Death, the Conſpirators ordered ſome of their <hi>Miniſters, viz. Marſhal, Nye, Caryl, Salway</hi> and <hi>Dell,</hi> to pray with Him, as they ſaid, in order to His paſſage out of this Life; but when theſe ſent to let Him know the end of their coming, He returned anſwer that <hi>He was buſie:</hi> they ſent a ſecond time, and He replyed that <hi>He was at His Devotions:</hi> they importunately ſent a third time, and my Lord of <hi>London</hi> then deſiring to know what anſwer he ſhould give to ſatisfie them; His Majeſty then as unconcerned in their Miniſtery ſaid, <hi>My Lord, you may give them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104649:110"/>what anſwer you pleaſe, but I am reſolved, that they who have ſo often and ſo cauſeleſly prayed</hi> againſt <hi>Me, ſhall not in this My Agony pray</hi> with <hi>Me, they may pray</hi> for <hi>Me if they pleaſe.</hi> Therefore the <hi>King</hi> arming Himſelf with His own Devotions in the Offices of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in them found an unexpected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for the Goſpel for that Day being the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Paſſion of our Saviour, did by that Example ſtrengthen the <hi>King</hi> to follow <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to take up His Croſs; and His Majeſty was thankful for that Pattern. Being thus confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Blood (for He took the Sacrament that Morning) and ſufferings of His LORD (whoſe Vicegerent He was) together with His own Innocency, againſt the Terrors of Death, He was brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s through the Park to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> walking very faſt, and with as chearful a Countenance as if He were going to Hunting, (a Recreation He was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with,) often adviſing His ſlow Guards to move faſter, adding, <hi>I now go before you to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown, with leſs ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than I formerly have led My Souldiers for an Earthly Diadem.</hi> And being come to the end of the Park, He with much Alacrity went up the Stairs leading to the long Gallery in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Cabinet-Chamber,</hi> where He continued ſome time in Devotion, while they were fitting the Theatre of His Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:104649:110"/>While theſe things were acting, the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> who had alwayes forborn any publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the practices of this Murther, had taken up (as is credibly reported) ſome Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, (either in abhorrency of the Crime, or by the Solicitations of others) with his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, though none elſe ſhould follow him, to hinder the Execution. This being ſuſpected or known, <hi>Cromwell, Ireton</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi> coming to him, after their uſual way of deceiving, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade him, that the LORD <hi>had rejected the King,</hi> and with ſuch like Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as they knew had formerly prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, concealing that they had that very morning ſigned the Warrant for the Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they alſo deſired him <hi>with them to ſeek the LORD by Prayer, that they might know his mind in the thing.</hi> Which he aſſenting to, <hi>Harriſon</hi> was appointed for the Duty, and by compact to draw out his profane and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Diſcourſe to God in ſuch a length as might give time for the Execution, which they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſent to their Inſtruments to haſten; of which when they had notice that it was paſt, they roſe up, and perſwaded the General that this was a full return of Prayer, and God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo manifeſted his pleaſure they were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in it. There was likewiſe another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made by Col. <hi>Downes,</hi> who had diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their Court, to obſtruct them in their Execution; for it is ſaid, that he endeavoured
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104649:111"/>to make a Mutiny in the Army to hinder the Wickedneſs, but the haſt of the Aſſaſſinates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him.</p>
            <p>While theſe men acted their Wickedneſs by Prayers, to the laſting reproach of Chriſtianity, the <hi>King,</hi> after He had ſiniſhed His Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was through the <hi>Banqueting</hi>-Houſe brought to the Scaffold, which was dreſs'd to terrour, for it was all hung with Black, where were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending two Executioners in Diſguiſes, and the Axe and the Block prepared. But it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to affright Him whoſe Soul was already panting after another Life. And therefore He entred this ignominious and gaſtly Theatre with the ſame mind as He uſed to carry to His Throne, ſhewing no fear of death, but a Solicitude for thoſe that ſhould live after Him. Looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout He ſaw divers Companies of Horſe and Foot ſo placed on each ſide of the Street and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Scaffold, that the People could not come near Him, and thoſe that ſaw could not be Hearers; therefore omitting that Speech which it was probable He would have ſpoken to the People, He ſpoke to the Officers, and thoſe that were then about Him, that which is now printed among His Works.</p>
            <p>Having ended His Speech, He declared His Profeſſion of Religion; and while He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the Block, He expreſſed what were His Hopes (for all the Righteous have ſuch) in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104649:111"/>Death, ſaying, <hi>I have a good Cauſe and a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God on my ſide; I go from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the world.</hi> After this compoſing Himſelf to an Addreſs to God, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Eyes and Hands like fore-runners lifted up to Heaven, and expreſſing ſome ſhort and private Ejaculations, He kneeled down before the Block as at a Desk of Prayer, and meekly ſubmitted His <hi>Crowned Head</hi> to the pleaſure of His God, to be profaned by the Axe of the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Executioner:</hi> which was ſuddenly ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from His Body by one ſtrong ſtroke. <hi>So ſell CHARLES the Firſt, and with Him expired the Glory and Liberty of Three Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>King</hi> finiſhed His Martyrdom, but His Enemies not their Malice, who extended their Cruelty beyond His Life, and abuſed the Headleſs Trunk. Some waſhed their hands in the Royal Blood, others dipt their ſtaves in it; and that they might indulge their inſatiate Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs as well as their boundleſs Inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they ſold the chips of the Block, and the ſands that were diſcoloured with His Blood, and expoſed His very Hairs to ſale: which the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators purchaſed for different uſes. Some did it to preſerve the Reliques of ſo Glorious a Prince, whom they ſo dearly loved. Others hoped that they would be as means of Cure for that diſeaſe which our Engliſh <hi>Kings</hi> (through the Indulgence of Heaven) by Their touch did
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104649:112"/>uſually heal: and it was reported that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques experienced failed not of the effect. And ſome out of a brutiſh malice would have them as ſpoils and trophees of their hatred to their Lawfull Sovereign. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he might feed his eyes with Cruelty, and ſatisfie his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Ambition, which aſpired at <hi>Monarchy</hi> when the Lawfull King was deſtroyed, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſurveyed the murthered Carcaſs when it was brought in the Coffin into <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and to aſſure himſelf the <hi>King</hi> was quite dead, with his ſingers ſearched the wound, whether the Head were fully ſevered from the body or no.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they delivered the body to be unbowelled to an infamous <hi>Empirick</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, together with the rude <hi>Chirurgions</hi> of the Army (not permitting the <hi>King</hi>'s own Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to this Office) who were all moſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies to His Majeſty, and commanded them <hi>to ſearch</hi> (which was as much as to bid them ſo report) <hi>whether they could not find in it Symptomes of the French diſeaſe, or ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Frigidity, and natural impotency:</hi> that ſo they might have ſome colour to ſlander Him who was eminent for <hi>Chaſtity;</hi> or to make His Seed infamous. But this wicked deſign was prevented by a <hi>Phyſician</hi> of great Integrity and Skill, who intruding himſelf among them at the Diſſection, by his Preſence and Authority kept the obſequious Wretches from gratifying their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104649:112"/>Opprobrious Maſters. And the ſame <hi>Phyſician</hi> alſo publiſhed that Nature had tempered the Royal Body to a longer life than commonly is granted to other men. And as His Soul was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Heroick Vertues to <hi>Eternity,</hi> ſo His Body by a Temperament almoſt <hi>ad pondus</hi> made as near an approach to it as the preſent Condition of Mortality would permit.</p>
            <p>Failing in theſe Opportunities of Calumny, with more Impudence and Rancor they uſe other wayes to make Him odious, and raſe the Love of Him out of the People's hearts. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the outward unhappineſſes of His Reign unto an hatred of God againſt Him; and with the ſame Confidence as they inrolled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Liſt of the Saints, and entred their own names in the Book of Life, they blotted His out, and placed Him in ſome of the dark and comfortleſs Cells of the damned: and they commonly profeſſed it among the Diſciples of the Faction as an Article of their belief, that it was impoſſible for Him or any of His party to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Not content with theſe Injuries to His Body and Soul, they endeavour likewiſe to murther His <hi>Memory.</hi> For they pull'd down His <hi>Statue</hi> which was placed at the Weſt end of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and that other in the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> and leaving the Arch void, they writ over, <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus.</hi> But the Providence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104649:113"/>of God hath ſhewed them to be not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, but alſo deceived. For that Juſt Prince hath of His own Seed to ſit upon His Throne. And Poſterity ſhall wonder at the Vanity as well as the Falſeneſs of thoſe men, that they ſhould think to deſtroy the Memory of that Prince whoſe true and laſting Glory conſiſted not in any thing wherein it was poſſible for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to ſhew the Power of their Malice, but in <hi>a ſolid Vertue, which flouriſheth by Age, and whoſe Fame gathers ſtrength from multitude of Years, when Statues and Monuments are obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the flames of a Violent Envy, and the Ruines of Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, they take care to ſuppreſs all thoſe more Lively figures of Him and moſt laſting Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, His Writings, and therefore force from My Lord of <hi>London,</hi> whom they kept priſoner, all thoſe Papers His Majeſty had delivered to him, and make a moſt narrow ſearch of his Cloathes and Cabinets, leſt any of thoſe Monuments of Piety and Wiſdom ſhould eſcape to the Benefit of Mankind. Yet by the gracious Goodneſs of the Almighty God, to their eternal infamy, and for a perpetual Record of the <hi>King</hi>'s great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there eſcaped their Search, and was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World, <hi>The Book of His Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Soliloquies.</hi> In the Compoſition of which a Sober Reader cannot tell which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire moſt, either His incredible Prudence, His ardent Piety, or His Majeſtick and truly Royal
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104649:113"/>
               <hi>Style.</hi> Thoſe parts of it which conſiſted of Addreſſes to God correſponded ſo nearly in the Occaſions, and were ſo full of the Piety and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that they ſeemed to be dictated by the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p>His very Aſſaſſinates confeſſed the goodneſs of the Book, though they were aſhamed He whom they had murthered ſhould be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. For <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in his Examination of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> who Printed it, asked him, <hi>How he could think ſo bad a man</hi> (for ſuch would that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter have this Excellent Prince thought to be) <hi>could write ſo good a Book.</hi> Therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by all wayes and means to ſuppreſs it, as the greateſt witneſs againſt them to Poſterity, and which would make them odious in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. For <hi>the Blood of the Holy, Wiſe and Eloquent, leaves eternal ſtains of Infamy upon thoſe that ſpill'd it; becauſe no man reads their Works, but they curſe thoſe cruel hands which cut the veins and ſtopp'd the ſtreams of ſo much Goodneſs; and we eſteem them barbarous and inhumane Monſters who did not Reverence the Perſons of thoſe whoſe Writings we admire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their fury became ridiculous, while they thought by their preſent power to corrupt His Memory, and take off the admiration of the following Ages; for the more they hindred the Publication, the more earneſtly it was ſought after: yet they endeavoured it another way,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104649:114"/>and therefore hired certain mercenary Souls to deſpoil the <hi>King</hi> of the Credit of being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. Eſpecially one baſe Scribe, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fitted to compoſe Satyres and invent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, who made himſelf notorious by ſome licentious and infamous Pamphlets, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf as fit for their ſervice. This man they encouraged (by tranſlating him from a needy Pedagogue to the Office of a Secretary) to write that Scandalous Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (an Invective againſt the <hi>King</hi>'s Meditations) and to anſwer the learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Defence of <hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi> But all was in vain, for thoſe that were able to judge of <hi>Styles</hi> found it muſt be the ſame Pen which wrought theſe Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and drew thoſe Letters which the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had publiſhed for His. Others, that were not able to ſatisfie themſelves by ſuch a Cenſure, were aſſured of it by the Relations of Colonel <hi>Hammond</hi> that was His Keeper, who did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to ſeveral Perſous that he ſaw them in the <hi>King</hi>'s hand, heard Him read them, and did ſee Him to correct them in his preſence. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> did alſo affirm to thoſe he converſed with, that he was employed by a Command from the <hi>King</hi> to get ſome of them out of the hands of the Faction, for they were taken in His Cabinet at <hi>Naſeby.</hi> And <hi>Royſton</hi> that Printed them did teſtifie to thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, that the <hi>King</hi> had ſent to him the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> before His death; to provide a Preſs for ſome Papers He ſhould ſend to Him,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104649:114"/>which were theſe, together with a deſign for a Picture before the Book; which at firſt was Three Crowns indented on a Wreath of Thorns, but afterwards the <hi>King</hi> recalled that, and ſent that other which is now before His Book. Thus theſe ſeveral Teſtimonies did ſecure the faith of the World againſt the Slanderers, and made their endeavours as contemptible as themſelves were hatefull.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Parricides</hi> were ſeeking for freſh Occaſions to expreſs their Malice, the whole Kingdom was compoſed to Mourning and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; for never any <hi>King,</hi> not only of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but of whatſoever Throne, had His death lamented with greater Sorrows, nor left the World with a higher regret of the People. When the news of His Death was divulged, Women with Child for grief caſt forth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Fruit of their Womb, like Her that fell in Travel when <hi>the Glory was departed from Iſrael.</hi> Others, both Men and Women, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Convulſions and ſwounding Fits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſo deep a Melancholy as attended them to the Grave. Some unmindful of themſelves, as though they could not, or would not, live when their beloved Prince was ſlaughtered, (it is reported) ſuddenly fell down dead. The Pulpits were likewiſe bedewed with unſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tears; and ſome of thoſe to whom the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>King</hi> was for Epiſcopacie's ſake leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, yet now bewailed the loſs of Him
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104649:115"/>when dead. Children (who uſually ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in publick Calamities) were alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the news, and became ſo prodigal of their Tears, that for ſome time they refuſed comfort; even ſome of thoſe who ſat as Judges could not forbear to mingle ſome Tears with His Blood when it was ſplit. Many compoſed Elegies and ſerious Poems to preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of His Vertues, to expreſs their own Griefs, and to inſtruct the Mournings of others; and their Paſſions made them above their uſual Strain more elegant. Many who writ the Acts of His time did vindicate His Honour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged the baſe Arts of His Enemies, even while their Power was dreadful.</p>
            <p>Men of all Sorts, Degrees and Sects (there being none among which He had not ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers) then freely and without Envy recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His ſeveral Vertues, which now appeared as great as Mortality refined by Induſtry was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. For <hi>though Proſperity makes the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt tryals of Vertues, yet Adverſity renders them moſt Orient.</hi> As the night beſt acquaints us with the Splendor of the Stars.</p>
            <p>That which firſt challenged their Wonder, was the Compoſure and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Soul to <hi>Religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Majeſties Religion.</note> which He uſed not as an Artifice of Empire, but as the Ornament and Comfort of a private breaſt; for He never
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104649:115"/>affected a Magnifick Piety nor a Pompous Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but laboured to approve Himſelf in ſecret to that God who rewardeth openly. All His Offices in this were, like His Fortune, far above thoſe of other men; His Devotion in Prayer was ſo raiſed, that His Soul ſeemed to be wholly ſwallowed up in the Contemplation of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty He did adore, and as in an Ecſtaſie to have left His ſenſes without its Adſiſtency. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this was given at the Death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the news of whoſe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being whiſpered to the <hi>King</hi> while He was at Prayers, He took no notice of it (although it was ſo weighty an Occurrence to have His prime Miniſter cut off in the buſie Preparations for a great Deſign) till He had finiſhed His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to Heaven, and His Spirit was diſmiſſed from the Throne of Grace to attend the Cares of that on Earth. This was ſo clear an Evidence of a moſt fixed Devotion, that thoſe who built their Hopes upon His Reproaches, ſlanderouſly imputed it to a ſecret Pleaſure in the fall of him whoſe Greatneſs was now terrible to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that raiſed it; which both His Majeſties care of the Duke's Children afterwards, as alſo the Conſideration of His Condition, did evince to be falſe, and that the <hi>King</hi> neither hated him, nor needed to fear him whom He could have ruined with a Frown, and have obliged the People by permitting their fury to paſs upon him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, His Majeſty's conſtant Diligence in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104649:116"/>thoſe Duties did demonſtrate, that nothing but a Principle of Holineſs, which is alwayes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, both moved and aſſiſted Him in thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Performances, to which He was obſerved to go with an exceeding Alacrity as to a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure, from which no leſſer Pleaſures nor Buſineſs were ſtrong enough for a Diverſion. In the morning before He went to <hi>Hunting</hi> (His beloved Sport) the Chaplains were before Day call'd to their Miniſtery: and when He was at <hi>Brainford</hi> among the Noiſe of Arms, and near the Aſſaults of His Enemies, He cauſed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that then waited to perform his accuſtomed Service, before He provided for Safety, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted at Victory; and would firſt gain upon the Love of Heaven, and then afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Malice of men. Thoſe that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Parliament to attend Him in His Reſtraints wondred at His conſtant Devotions in His Cloſet; and no Artifice of the Army was ſo likely to abuſe Him to a Credulity of their good Intentions, as the Permiſſion of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of His Chaplains in the Worſhip of God, a mercy He valued, to ſome of His Servants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of enjoying Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>At Sermons He carried Himſelf with ſuch a Reverence and Attention (that His Enemies which hated, yet did even admire Him in it,) as if He were expecting new Inſtructions for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from that God whoſe Deputy He was, or a new Charter for a larger Empire: and He
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104649:116"/>was ſo careful not to neglect any of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, that if on Tueſday mornings, on which Dayes there uſed to be Sermons at Court, He were at any diſtance from thence, He would ride hard to be preſent at the beginnings of them.</p>
            <p>When the State of His Soul required, He was as ready to perform thoſe more ſevere parts of Religion which ſeem moſt diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood. And he never refuſed to take to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſhame of thoſe acts wherein He had tranſgreſſed, that He might give Glory to His God. For after the Army had forced Him from <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and in their ſeveral removes had brought Him to <hi>Latmas,</hi> an houſe of the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> on <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. being Sunday, in the morning before Sermon He led forth with Him into the Garden the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> (who then attended on Him, and whom He was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to uſe as His Confeſſour) and drawing out of His pocket a Paper, commanded him to read it, tranſcribe it, and ſo to deliver it to Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This Paper contained ſeveral Vows, which He had obliged His Soul unto for the Glory of His Maker, the advance of true Piety, and the emolument of the Church. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them this was one, that <hi>He would do Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Penance for the Injuſtice He had ſuffered to be done to the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>His conſent to thoſe Injuries that were done to the Church of</hi> England (though at that time He had yielded to no more than the taking away of the High
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104649:117"/>Commiſſion, and the Biſhops power to Vote in Parliament) <hi>and to the Church of</hi> Scotland: and adjured the Doctor, that <hi>if ever he ſaw Him in a Condition to obſerve that or any of thoſe Vows, he ſhould ſolicitouſly mind Him of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he dreaded the guilt of the breach ſhould lie upon his own Soul.</hi> This voluntary ſubmiſſion to the Laws of Chriſtianity exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſo memorable humiliation of the good Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> for he never bewailed the blood of thoſe ſeven thouſand men which in three hours ſpace he cauſed to be ſpilt at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> till the reſolution of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made him ſenſible of the Crime. But the Piety of King <hi>Charles</hi> anticipated the ſeverity of a Confeſſor for thoſe offences to which He had been precipitated by the Violence of others.</p>
            <p>This Zeal and Piety proceeded from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of His whole Soul to the Honour of His God, for <hi>Religion</hi> was as Imperial in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual as in the Affectionate Faculties of it. The Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was His not ſo much by Education, as Choice, and He ſo well underſtood the Grounds of it, that He valued them above all other Pretenſions to Truth, and was able to maintain it againſt all its Adverſaries. His Diſcourſe with <hi>Henderſon</hi> ſhews how juſt a Reverence He had for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholick Church, againſt the Pride and Ignorance of Schiſmaticks; yet not to proſtitute His Faith to the Adulterations of the Roman Infallibility and Traditions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:104649:117"/>Nevertheleſs the moſt violent Slanders the Faction laboured to pollute Him with, were thoſe that rendred Him inclinable to Popery. From which He was ſo averſe, that He could not forbear in His indearments to the <hi>Queen,</hi> (when He committed a ſecret to Her Breaſt which He would not truſt to any other, and when He admired and applauded Her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Cares for His Honour and Safety) in a Letter, which He thought no Eye but Hers ſhould have peruſed, to let Her know that He ſtill differ'd from Her in Religion; for He ſays, <hi>It is the only thing of Difference in Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> Malice made the Slanderers blind, and they publiſhed this Letter to the World, than which there could not be a greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence imaginable of the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt ſecret Thoughts, and Inward Sincerity, nor a more ſhameful Conviction of their Impudence and damnable Falſhood. Nor did He only tell the <hi>Queen</hi> ſo, but He made Her ſee it in His Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For as ſoon as His Children were born, it was His firſt Care to prevent the Satisfaction of their Mother in baptizing them after the Rites of Her own Church. When He was to Die, a time moſt ſeaſonable to ſpeak Truth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Him who all His Life knew not how to Diſſemble, He declares His Profeſſion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be the ſame with that which He found left by His Father King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:104649:118"/>How little the Papiſts credited what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would have the World believe, was too evident by the Conſpiracies of their <hi>Fathers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Life and Honour, which the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Habernefield</hi> (to whoſe relations the following practices againſt Him and the Church of <hi>England</hi> gained a belief) brought to light. They were mingled likewiſe among the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and both heated and directed their Fury againſt Him. They were as importunate in their Calumnies of Him, even after His Death, as were the vileſt of the Sectaries; which they had never done, could they have imagined Him to be theirs; for His Blood would in their Calendar have out-ſhined the Multitude of their fictitious Saints. For His ſake they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their hatred to His Family, abetted the Uſurpations of the following Tyrant, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the World new <hi>Rules of Obedience and Government,</hi> invented freſh Calumnies for the Son, and obſtructed by various Methods His return to the Principality, becauſe He was Heir as well of the Faith as of the Throne of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Although this Honour is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to many Gallant Perſons of that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that their Loyalty was not ſo corrupted by their Faith to <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they laboured to prevent the Father's Overthrow, and to haſten the Son's Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>He was not ſatisfied in being Religious as a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104649:118"/>particular Chriſtian, but would be ſo as a <hi>King,</hi> and indeavoured that Piety might be as Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal as His Empire. This He aſſaied by giving Ornaments and Aſſiſtances to the External Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and Parts of it, (which is the proper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of a Magiſtrate, whoſe Power reaches but to the Outward man) that ſo carnal minds if they were not brought to an Obedience, might yet to a Reverence, and if men would not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet they ſhould not deſpiſe Religion. This He did in taking Care for the Place of Worſhip, that Comelineſs and Decency ſhould be there conſpicuous where the God of Order was to be adored. And it was a Royal Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to reſtore St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtrength, and give it a beauty as magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as its Structure. He taught men not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Diſpenſers of the Goſpel, becauſe He had ſo great an eſteem for them, admitting ſome to His neareſt Confidence and moſt Private Counſels, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and the greateſt Place of Truſt, as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to the Treaſury: conſulting at once the Emolument of Religion, whoſe Dictates are more powerfully impreſſed when the Miniſter is honoured by the Magiſtrate; and the Benefit of the State, which wiſe Princes had before found none to ſeek more faithfully, if any did more prudently, than Church-men.</p>
            <p>Though a Voluntary Poverty did much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the luſtre and increaſe of the Church
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104649:119"/>in the Purer times, yet a neceſſitated would have deſtroyed it in a Corrupt age; therefore the <hi>King,</hi> to obſtruct all acceſs of Ruine that way, ſecured her Patrimony, and recovered as much as He could out of the Jaws of Sacrilege, which together with time had devoured a great part of it. His endeavours this way were ſo ſtrong, that the Faction in <hi>Scotland</hi> found no Artifice able to divert them but by kindling the flame of a Civil War; the Criminals there ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to adjuſt their Sacrilegious Acquiſitions by Rebellious practices, and to deſtroy that Church by force which His Majeſty would not ſuffer them to torture with Famine. In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Lord Lieutenant <hi>Wentworth,</hi> by His Command and Inſtructions, retrived very great Poſſeſſions, which the tumults of that Nation had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged many greedy Perſons to ſeize upon, and would not ſuffer Sedition to be incouraged with the hopes of Impiety. In <hi>England</hi> He countenanced thoſe juſt Pleas which Oppreſſed Incumbents entred againſt Rapacious Patrons; and this way many Curates were put into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of giving Hoſpitality, who before were contemptible in their Miniſtry, becauſe they were ſo in their Fortune. His Enemies knew how Inviolable was the Faith of His Majeſty in this, and therefore preſſed Him with nothing more to obſtruct Peace than the Alienation of Church-Lands, rather than which He did aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don His Life, and parted ſooner with His Blood than them. He uſed to ſay, <hi>Though I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104649:119"/>enough of the Dangers that attend My Care of the Church, yet I am reſolved to defend it or make it My Tomb-ſtone,</hi> (alluding to a Story which He would tell of a Generous Captain, that ſaid ſo of a Caſtle that was committed to His truſt.) He had ſo perfect a Deteſtation of that Crime, that it is ſaid He ſcarce ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. without an Abhorrency of His Sacriledge. He neglected the Advices of His own Party, if they were negligent of the Welfare of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Conceſſions He had made in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the prejudice of the Church there, were the ſubject of His grief and penitential Confeſſions both before God (as appears in His Prayers) and men. For when the Reverend Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> (whom He had ſent for to the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where he employed his diligence and prudence to ſearch into the Intrigues and Reſerves of the Commiſſioners) had acquainted Him how the Commiſſioners were the more pertinacious for the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy here, becauſe His Majeſty had conſented to it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and withall told Him what anſwer he himſelf had made to them, That <hi>perchance the King was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to thoſe grants by a misinformation that that Act which was made in King</hi> James<hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority againſt Biſhops was yet unrepealed, and that His Conceſſion would but leave them where the Law had;</hi> The King Anſwered, <hi>It is true,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104649:120"/>I was told ſo, but whenever you hear that urged again, give them this anſwer, and ſay, that you had it from the King Himſelf; That when I did that in</hi> Scotland, <hi>I ſinned againſt My Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that I have often repented of it, and hope that God hath forgiven Me that great Sin, and by God's grace for no Conſideration in the World will I ever do ſo again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was careful of Uniformity, both becauſe He knew the Power of Juſt and Lawful Princes conſiſted in the Union of their Subjects, who never are cemented ſtronger than by a Unity in Religion; but Tyrants, who meaſure their greatneſs by the weakneſs of their Vaſſals, work that moſt effectually by careſſing Schiſms, and giving a Licence to different Perſwaſions (as the Uſurpers afterwards did:) Beſides, He ſaw <hi>there was no greater Impediment to a ſincere Piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Time and thoſe Parts which might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Godlineſs to a Growth, were all Waſted and Corrupted in Malice and Slanders betwixt the Diſſenters about forms.</hi> He was more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in preſerving the Truths of Chriſtianity than the Rights of His Throne. For when the Commiſſioners of the Two Houſes in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> importunately preſſed Him for a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Leſſer <hi>Catechiſm</hi> which the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had compoſed, and uſed this motive, becauſe it was a ſmall matter; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Though it ſeem to you a ſmall thing, it is not ſo to Me: I had rather give you one of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104649:120"/>Flowers of My Crown, than permit your Children to be corrupted in the leaſt point of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Thus though He could not infuſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Graces into the minds of His Subjects, yet He would manage their Reaſon by Pious Arts; and what the <hi>Example of a King (which through the Corruptions of men is more efficacious to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety than to Vertue)</hi> could not do, that His Law ſhould, and He would reſtrain thoſe Vices which He could not extirpate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> was never uſed by Him to veil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; for this was peculiar to His Adverſaries,
<note place="margin">His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> who when they were plotting ſuch acts as Hell would bluſh at, they would fawn and ſmile on Heaven; and they uſed it as thoſe ſubtle Surpriſers in War, who wear their Enemies Colours till they be admitted to butcher them within their own Fortreſſes. But His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty conſulted the Peace of His Conſcience not only in Piety to God, but alſo in <hi>Juſtice</hi> to Men. He was, as a <hi>Magiſtrate ſhould be, a ſpeaking Law.</hi> It was His uſual ſaying, <hi>Let Me ſtand or fall by My own Counſels. I will ever, with</hi> Job, <hi>rather chuſe Miſery than Sin.</hi> He firſt ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted His Counſels to the Cenſure of the Lawyers before they were brought forth to Execution. Thoſe Acts of which the Faction made moſt noiſe, were delivered by the Judges to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sphere of the Prerogative. The cauſes of the Revenue were as freely debated as private
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104649:121"/>Pleas, and ſometimes decreed to be not good; which can never happen under a bad Prince. The Juſtice of His Times ſhewed that of His Breaſt, wherein the Laws were feared and not Men. None were forced to purchaſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with the diminution of their Eſtates, or the loſs of their Credit. Every one had both ſecurity and ſafety for His Life, Fortune, and Dignity; and it was not then thought, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to be a part of Wiſdom to provide againſt Dangers by obſcurity and Privacies. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in beſtowing Great Offices never ſecured the Receivers from the force of the Law, but Equity overcame His Indulgences. For He knew that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Princes become Odious to them that made them ſo.</hi> He ſubmitted the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventrey</hi> to an Examination when a querulous perſon had accuſed him of Bribery. He ſharply reproved one whom He had made Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, when he was petitioned againſt by an <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Knight, on whoſe Eſtate, being held by Leaſe from the Crown, that Treaſurer had a deſign; and He ſecured the Petitioner in his Right. The greateſt Officer of His Court did not dare to do any the leaſt of thoſe injuries which the moſt Contemptible Member of the Houſe of Commons would with a daily Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy act upon His weaker Neighbour. In the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Diſcords He bewailed nothing more, than that the Sword of Juſtice could not correct the illegal Furies of that of War. Though by His Conceſſions and Grants He diminiſhed His
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104649:121"/>Power, yet He thought it a Compenſation, to let the World ſee He was willing to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Monarchy to have an unjuſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſecure Poſterity from Evil Kings. Although He proved to a Leading Lord of the Faction, <hi>That a People being too cautious to bind their King by Laws from doing Ill, do likewiſe fetter Him from doing Good, and their fears of Miſchief do deſtroy their hopes of Benefit. And that ſuch is the weakneſs of Humanity, that he which is intruſted only to Good, may pervert that Power to the extremeſt Ills.</hi> And indeed there is no ſecurity for a Community to feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Government beſides the Advantages of it, but in the Benignity of Providence, and the Juſtice of the Prince, both which we enjoyed while we enjoyed Him.</p>
            <p>Though He was thus in Love with Juſtice, yet He ſuffered not that to leven His Nature to Severity and Rigour,
<note place="margin">His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> but tempered it with <hi>Clemency,</hi> eſpecially when His Goodneſs could poſſibly find out ſuch an Interpretation for the Offence, that it ſtruck more at His Peculiar than the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt. He ſeemed almoſt ſtupid in the Opinion of Cholerick Spirits as to a ſenſe of His own Injuries, when there was no fear leſt His Mercy ſhould thereby increaſe the Miſeries of His People. And He was ſo ambitious of the Glory of Moderation, that He would acquire it it in deſpight of the Malignity of the times.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:104649:122"/>For <hi>the Exerciſe of this Vertue depends not only on the temper of the Prince, but the frame of the People muſt contribute to it; becauſe when the Reverence of Majeſty and fear of the Laws are proſcribed, ſharper Methods are required to form Obedience.</hi> Yet He was unwilling to cut off, till He had tryed by Mercy to amend, even guilty Souls. Thus He ſtrove to oblige the Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merino</hi> to peaceful practices, by continuing that Life which had been employed in Sedition, and forfeited to the Law.</p>
            <p>Soon after His coming into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> (by which time He had experienced the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Frauds and implacable Malice of His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) being attended on by Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (for they were the earlieſt in their Duties at that time) a Diſcourſe paſſed betwixt His Majeſty and the Governour, wherein there was mention made of the fears of the Faction that the King could never forgive them. To which the King immediately replyes, <hi>I tell thee, Governour, I can forgive them with as good an appetite as ever I eat My Dinner after an hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that I aſſure you was not a ſmall one; yet I will not make My ſelf a better Chriſtian than I am, for I think if they were Kings I could not do it ſo eaſily.</hi> This ſhewed how prone His Soul was to Mercy, and found not any obſtruction but what aroſe from a ſenſe of Royal Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:104649:122"/>He ſooner offered and gave life to His captive Enemies than their Spirits debauched by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion would require it, and He was ſparing of that blood of which their fury made them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal. No man fell in battel whom He could ſave. He choſe rather to enjoy any Victory by Peace (and therefore continually ſollicited for it when He ſeemed leaſt to need it) than make one triumph a ſtep to another; and though He was paſſionate to put all in Safety, yet He affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rather to end the War by Treaty than by Conqueſt. The Priſoners He took He uſed like deluded men, and oftner remembred that God had made them His Subjects, than that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had transformed them to Rebels. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them while in His Power, and not to let them languiſh in Priſon, ſent them by Paſſes to their own homes, only ingaging them by Oath to no more injuries againſt that Sovereign whom they had felt to be Gracious: for ſo He uſed thoſe that were taken at <hi>Brainford.</hi> But yet the Caſuiſts of the Cauſe would ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with their Faith, and ſend them forth to die in contracting a new guilt. Thoſe whom the fury of War had left gaſping in the Field; and fainting under their wounds, He commends in His Warrants, (as in that to the Major of <hi>Newbury</hi>) to the care of the Neighbourhood, either tenderly to recover, or decently bury: and His Commands were as well for thoſe that ſought to murther Him as thoſe that were wounded in His Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:104649:123"/>This made the Impudence and Falſhood of <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> more portentous, when in his Speech of the Aſſaſſination he belch'd out thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> the firſt would kill numbers of Senators to make himſelf Sport, and the laſt thought it juſt enough that <hi>Paetus Thraſeas</hi> ſhould die, becauſe he look'd like a School-maſter. But this <hi>Prince</hi>'s Anger was without Danger to any, His Admonitions were frequent, Corrections ſeldom, but Revenge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. He grieved when His Pity had not Power or Skill to ſave Offenders, and then He puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bad, but yet gave them ſpace to repent, and make their Execution as near as He could like a natural Death, to tranſlate them from hence to a place where they could not Sin. He had nothing of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in Him, which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> requires in ſuch Princes as make Succeſs the only end of their Counſels, and conſult a proſperous Grandeur more than an unſpotted Conſcience. He ſcorned to abuſe the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of God upon Him by turning a <hi>Fox</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and abhorred to think that He whom Heaven had made above other men ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to the Cruelty of a <hi>Lion.</hi> He ſooner parted with Mortality than Mercy; for He end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His dayes with a Prayer for His Enemies, and laboured to make His Clemency immortal, by commanding the practice of it to His Son.</p>
            <p>None of His Vertues were in the Confines of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104649:123"/>Vice, and therefore this Admirable Clemency proceeded not from a defect of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as His Detractors imputed it,
<note place="margin">His Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and <hi>the Vulgar,</hi> who <hi>miſtake Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty for Valour,</hi> imagined; but like the Bowels of the Supremeſt Mercy which are incircled with an Infinite Power, ſo this Pity to guilty and frail men was attended with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Fortitude.</hi> For this Vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in deſpiſing Dangers and Enemies in thoſe Cauſes that render Death comely and glorious, the <hi>King</hi> gave ſeveral Evidences of a Contempt of all Power beneath that of Heaven. When the Lord <hi>Rey</hi> firſt acquainted Him with the Conſpiracy of <hi>Ramſey</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> He was upon a Remove to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was to wait upon Him as Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber; who having ſome notice given him of the Diſcovery, beſought His Majeſty to ſpare his attendance till he could clear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and return the Treaſon upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer. The <hi>King</hi> anſwered, that He would therefore make him <hi>wait, to let him ſee He did as little fear his ſtrength as diſtruſt his Loyalty; for He knew he durſt not attempt His Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He was reſolved to ſell it ſo dear.</hi> And to make good His Confidence, He made him ride alone with Him in His Coach to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and lie in His Chamber that Night: while the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Court admired, and even cenſured, His Magnanimity, for it went beyond His pattern, and did more than that Emperour who was ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104649:124"/>the <hi>Delight of Mankind,</hi> who being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Conſpiracy againſt him, invited the two Chiefs of it to accompany him to the <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> and cauſed them both to ſit next on each ſide to him in the Theatre; and to give them more advantage for their deſign, put the ſwords of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> (under colour of enquiring their judgements concerning their ſharpneſs) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, to ſhew how little dread he had of their fury. But the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince's Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity exceeded that of the Excellent <hi>Roman</hi>'s, as much as the privacies of a Bed-chamber, and the darkneſs of Night make up a fitter Scene for the Aſſaſſination of a beloved Soveraign than a publick Theatre.</p>
            <p>As He never provoked War, ſo He never feared it; and when the miſerable Neceſſity lay upon Him to take up Arms to preſerve Himſelf from an unjuſt Violence, He ſhewed as much if not more Valour than thoſe can boaſt of that with equal force finiſhed Wars with Conqueſt: in the ſucceſs of theſe, Fortune, the Vanity of an Enemy, and the aſſiſtances of Friends may challenge a part of the Praiſe, but in that none but His own brave Soul had the Glory. For to attempt at Victory againſt an Enemy that had almoſt more Forts and Garriſons than He had Families to joyn with Him, that with Cannon out-vied the Number of His Muskets, that had gotten from Him a Navy which His Care had made the moſt formidable in the World, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104649:124"/>not left Him the command of a Cock-boat, that were prodigal with the Treaſure of a Nation and His Revenues, when He begged for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; was ſuch a Courage that would have made that <hi>Senate</hi> of Gallant Perſons, who were the moſt competent Judges of Valour, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cenſured Vertue by the Succeſs, but thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Imprudent <hi>Conſul</hi> for not deſpairing of the Commonwealth, when he gathered up thoſe broken Legions which his Raſhneſs had obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to an Overthrow, to have decreed a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for <hi>CHARLES,</hi> had His life been an Honour to that Age, or could thoſe Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have reckoned Him among their great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Moſt men indeed thought the <hi>King</hi>'s ſide moſt glorious, yet they concluded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more terrible: thoſe that minded their Duty were in the Royal Camp, but ſuch as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Safety took part with the Faction, or at leaſt did not oppoſe them. As He firſt entred the War, ſo did He continue in it. His Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alwayes moved Him to deſire Peace, and His Fortitude made them ſometimes ſue for it. His Adverſaries never prevailed upon His Fears, but upon the Treachery and Covetouſneſs of ſome of His Party, who could not endure an Honourable Want: and on ſuch their Gold was ſtronger than their Iron on Him, and He was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Betrayed than Overcome.</p>
            <p>His Greatneſs of Mind forſook Him not with His Fortune, Arms and Liberty, it being Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104649:125"/>and not built upon them; this made Him tenacious of Majeſty when His Power was gone. For when <hi>Whaley,</hi> that had the Command of the Guards upon Him while He was in the Army, inſolently intruded into His Preſence to hear His Diſcourſe with a Foreign Miniſter of State, and being bold in his Power and Office, refuſed to obey the Command for a greater Diſtance, the <hi>King</hi> caned him to an Obſervance. When the Parricides ſent their party of Soldiers to force Him from the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> to the Slaughter, <hi>Cobbet</hi> that commanded them thruſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coach with Him: but the <hi>King</hi> ſenſible that the nearneſs of ſuch a Villain was like a Contagion to Majeſty, with His Hand forced him away to herd among his bloody fellows. His Spirit alwayes kept above the barbarous Malice of His Enemies, and of their rudeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries would ſeem unſenſible. He told a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servant of His, that the Conſpirators had kept Him for two Moneths under a want of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen and Shirts: <hi>But</hi> (ſaid He) <hi>I ſcorned to give them that pleaſure as to tell them I wanted.</hi> Thus all the ſtrokes of Fortune upon His Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Soul were but like the breaking of Waves upon a Rock of Diamonds, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhake, but only waſh it to a greater Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But though He knew not how to ſubmit to the Power of Men,
<note place="margin">His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> yet He would tremble under the Frowns of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104649:125"/>God. His great Spirit made Him not unquiet or furious under the Corrections of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But with a wonderful <hi>Patience (a Vertue not uſual with Kings, to whom the bounds of Equity ſeem a reſtraint, and therefore are more reſtleſs in Injuries)</hi> He did ſubmit to the Will of His eternal Sovereign. He never murmured nor repined at that Providence which had given Him plenty of tears to drink: But His Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtill breath the Juſtice of God and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of all His wayes with Him. He would take Occaſions from diſpleaſing Occurrences to thank God that had ſitted Him for the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had brought Him unto. For when He marched after His Carriage in purſuit of <hi>Eſſex</hi> into the Weſt, one of them broke in a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lane, which made Him ſtop till an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Shower of Rain came pouring upon Him; from which that He might ſeek for a Shelter in the Neighbouring Village, His Courtiers offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hew Him out a way through the Hedge with their Swords, but He refuſed: and when they wondred at it, He lifting up His hat and Eyes to worſhip the Fountain of All Grace, ſaid, <hi>As God hath given me Afflictions to exerciſe My Patience, ſo He hath given me Patience to bear My Afflictions.</hi> The Indignity He received from <hi>Hotham</hi> provoked no Curſe from Him, nor could the Injuries from <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> move Him to any thing more than Prayers for God's ſanctifying them to Him. He wanted not Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to Paſſion from His own Party; for in

            <p>When He was in His Captivity at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> under the ſtricteſt Reſtraint, thoſe that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him never almoſt obſerved Him but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleaſant in His Diſcourſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breaking out into pleaſing Reparties and Jeſts. When in the Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> (where He had occaſions of Paſſion daily adminiſtred by the Perverſeneſs to Peace of the Party He was to deal with) one of the Commiſſioners was importunate with Him for more Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and minded Him of His ſaying, <hi>That if there were another Treaty, it ſhould not lie in the power of the Devil's Malice to hinder Peace:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> anſwered, <hi>It would be ſo when there was a Treaty, but as for this it could not be thought a Treaty, but He was like the man in the Play, that cryed out he had been in a Fray, and when they asked him what Fray, he replyed there was a Fray and no Fray, for there were but three blows given, and he took them all: So this is a Treaty and not a Treaty, for there be many Conceſſions, but I have made them all.</hi> Another time, when He met one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters near His Chamber enquiring for Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> (who then waited on Him, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104649:127"/>had been faithful to Him in that Service) the <hi>King</hi> told him, <hi>He wondred he would have any more to do either with</hi> Titus <hi>or</hi> Timothy, <hi>ſince he fared ſo ill in medling with them in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about Epiſcopacy the day before.</hi> Theſe ſhewed how free His Soul was, and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the greateſt and moſt diſpleaſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</p>
            <p>He would never take any indirect courſes to avoid the Croſs, nay, He ſcrupled at ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients as ſome deemed moſt conducing to His great end. For at the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> there being offered to Him an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to ſecure His Conſcience and ſatisfie the Commiſſioners in the Propoſitions about the Church, and it being urged by a great and faithful Counſellour, that He muſt grant what poſſibly He could to preſerve His own Life for the good of the Church, for (it was ſaid) her ſafety depended on His; with a preſent and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indignation He replyed, <hi>Tell not Me what I ſhould do for ſaving of My Life, but what I may do with a ſafe Conſcience: God forbid that the Life or Safety of the Church ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon My Life, or upon the Life of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man; and I thank God I have a Son whom I have reaſon to believe will love the Church as well as I do.</hi> Another time, a little after the Treaty was ended, Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> ſhewing to Him a billet he had received by the Lady <hi>Wheeler</hi> the King's Laundreſs (who often conveyed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104649:128"/>much Intelligence) from an Officer of the Army, that the King's Death was reſolved on; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty anſwered, <hi>I have done what I can to ſave My Life without loſing of my Soul. I can do, I will do no more: God's will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Pomp of His Murther, wherein He was made a Spectacle to the World, Angels and Men, no Tryals were ever greater, nor ever were any better born: the Parricides found it was eaſie to take away His Life, but impoſſible His Honour and Patience; His Paſſions being then ſo low and quiet, that the natural Inſirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of His Speech did not in the leaſt meaſure appear, which uſes to be moſt evident in the ſmalleſt diſcompoſure of the Spirit. After the Regicides had paſſed their Decree for His Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination, and cauſed Him to be perſecuted with all the Indignities of the fanatick Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there fell from Him nothing like Paſſion or Indignation, but that He gave the Authors of thoſe Impieties the title that was due to them: for when my Lord of <hi>London</hi> came to Him, (which was not till eight a Clock on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday Night,) He told him, <hi>My Lord, that you came no ſooner I believe was not your fault; but now you are come, becauſe theſe Rogues pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue My Blood, you and I muſt conſult how I may beſt part with it.</hi> Yet even this was ſpoken without any Fury or Violence; for though all about Him was tumultuous with Horror, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Contempt, His Soul ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104649:128"/>enjoyed a Calm Serenity, and was full of its own Majeſty. This Vertue made Him forget He was a <hi>Prince</hi> born to Command, and only conſider that He was a Chriſtian whoſe Calling obliges to Suffer.</p>
            <p>He had found out a way to Glory by <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> For <hi>the ſupreme Power, to which nothing can be added,
<note place="margin">His Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> hath no better way to encreaſe, than when ſecured of its own Greatneſs it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it ſelf. And the Dignity of Princes is in nothing farther from Envy and Danger than in Humility.</hi> He deſpiſed the converſe of none, though poor, if honeſt: He ſhewed to Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Warwick</hi> (who had much of His Truſt and Affections) in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> a poor ragged Old Man, and told him <hi>he was a very honest fellow, and had been His beſt Company for two moneths together.</hi> He would have thoſe about Him converſe rather with Himſelf than with His Majeſty, and with them would He mingle Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as One of the People: none made an end of ſpeaking till His own Modeſty, not Pride in the <hi>King,</hi> thought it was enough: and He never did contradict any man without this mollifying Preface, <hi>By your favour, Sir.</hi> His diſcourſe as it was familiar, ſo it was directed to raiſe thoſe that heard it to a nearer approach to Himſelf by perfection; for He did not proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcoff at, but gently laboured to mend the defects of His Subjects. When Doctor <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:104649:129"/>had in ſome degree loſt the Manage of His Voice, His Majeſty ſhewed him his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and taught him to amend it; which that Excellent Perſon often mentioned as an inſtance of a Gracious Condeſcenſion of Majeſty. When Noble Youths came to take their leaves of Him before they went to foreign travel, He would not let them go without His Inſtructions, of which this was one, <hi>My Lord, Keep alwayes the beſt Company, and be ſure never to be Idle.</hi> Thus He would confer the Vertues as well as the Titles of Nobility, He laboured to keep them as Majeſty had made them, and that that blood might not be tainted in them which was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Anceſtors. Nor did He deſire that they ſhould be otherwiſe than He directed, as <hi>Tyrants and weak Princes will commend thoſe Vertues which they are afraid of, for they dread or envy their Subjects Parts and Abilities. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> obſerves that a <hi>Tyrant</hi> cares not to hear his Vaſſals ſpeak any thing that is either Grave or Generous; and it is reckoned among the Uſurpations of ſuch Monſters, that they would have the opinion to be the Only <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. Plato</hi> indangered his Life when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, becauſe he was thought to underſtand more than his Hoſt. It was obſerved of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (by one of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Teachers) that in the time of his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he loved no man that ſpoke Senſe, and had ſeveral Artiſices to diſparage it among his Slaves that attended him; and he would highly extol
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104649:129"/>thoſe Pulpit-Speakers that had moſt Canting and leaſt Reaſon. But the <hi>King</hi> thought it the Honour of Principality to rule over Excellent perſons, and affected to be Great only by being Better; and to raiſe their Spirits would ſtoop with His own.</p>
            <p>Of theſe He alwayes choſe the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed that He knew, to be His Miniſters of State and cloſeſt Confidents:
<note place="margin">His Choice of Miniſters of State.</note> for as <hi>the fortune of Princes ſtands in need of many Friends, which are the ſureſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Empire;</hi> ſo He would alwayes ſeek the Beſt, and thoſe He thought fitteſt for His Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which a bad or weak <hi>King</hi> would hate or fear. Therefore He had alwayes the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Pens and ableſt Heads in His Cauſe, and Perſons likewiſe of Integrity in His Service: for the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that were clamoured againſt as the greateſt Criminals, were not guilty enough, even by thoſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they were loaded with, and yet not proved, to receive the Cenſure of the Law, but were to be condemned in an unaccuſtomed way of ſpilling <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood. When ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Abilities even by oppoſing His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, He preferr'd the Publick Benefit which might be by their Endowments to His private Injuries; He would either buy them off to His Service by ſome Place of Truſt, or win them to His Friendſhip; unleſs He ſaw them to be ſuch
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104649:130"/>whoſe Natures were corrupted by their Deſigns, (for He had a moſt excellent Sagacity in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirits of men) or they were ſuch who polluted their parts by proſtituting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to ſome baſe ends (the injuries of which He could never neglect:) and ſuch He neither conceived Honourable in a Court, nor hoped they would ever be faithful and quiet in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Among theſe Purchaſes were reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> and others now living, whoſe Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions honoured His Judgement, and juſtified His Choice.</p>
            <p>He had no Favorite, as a Miniſter of Pleaſures,
<note place="margin">His Aſſection to His People.</note> to gratiſie whoſe Luſts and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties He might be ſollicited to do things contrary to the benefit of the Community; but all were Inſtruments of Government, and muſt be able to ſerve the Publick, whom He took to ſerve Himſelf. For no Prince was ever more aſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate of His People than He was, nor did He think His Intereſt ſeparate from theirs. Thoſe nice diſtinctions, and cautious limits of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Liberty which the Faction invented to enjealous the People with, were all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly compriſed by Him in an Uniform and Conſtant care of a juſt Government: none da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to adviſe Him to attempt at a power His Predeceſſors had parted with, or the Laws had concluded Him from. For He told the Lords,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104649:130"/>when He purged the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> from the Accuſation of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> (that he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed His Majeſty to make uſe of ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> to reduce this Kingdom; on which, though it had but a ſingle and various teſtimony, the Faction built their Practices againſt His Life) <hi>I think no body durſt ever be ſo impudent as to move Me to it, for if they had, I ſhould have made them ſuch an Example, and put ſuch a mark upon them, that all Poſterity ſhould know My Intentions by it. For My Intention was ever to govern by the Law, and not otherwiſe.</hi> He thought He could not be happy unleſs His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo; as we found our ſelves miſerable when He was not proſperous. Therefore He parted with ſo much of His Prerogative to buy our Peace, and purchaſe our Content. He ſought their Love by affecting them, the only way of gaining it, becauſe that Paſſion only is free and impatient of Command. Nor was He ever more pleaſed than in the enjoyment of it: When His Third Parliament granted five Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, and it was told Him that <hi>there was not One Voice diſſenting,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He wept for joy;</hi> and it had been happy for the People, if the <hi>King</hi> had alwayes had ſuch cauſe of Tears, and His Eyes had been alwayes wet with the ſame.</p>
            <p>Conteſts for Liberty could never have been more unſeaſonable than under this <hi>Prince,</hi> for He never denied His Subjects the removal of any juſt Grievance, yea, He parted ſometimes,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104649:131"/>through their own importunity deluded by the Faction, with that which ſhould have kept them Free: And when He made ſuch Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which tended to the prejudice of thoſe that deſired it, He would ſay to ſome about Him, that <hi>He would never have granted theſe things, but that He hoped they would ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of that power which they begg'd from Him, yet themſelves could not manage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it to its proper place, before it became their Ruine.</hi> He was far from the ambition of <hi>Ill Princes</hi> to <hi>ſeek an unlimited power;</hi> but He thought it <hi>the Office of the beſt Sovereign to ſet bounds to Liberty.</hi> He deſpiſed His Life if it were to be bought by the Miſery of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore rejected the Propoſitions of the Army as the Conditions of His Safety, when tendred to Him the day before His Murther, becauſe they would inſlave the People. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would He expoſe particular perſons to an evident and inevitable danger, though it were to ſecure Himſelf: for when my Lord <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and his Noble Lady, at whoſe houſe in <hi>Bagſhot</hi> He did ſtay as He was removed from <hi>Carisbrook</hi> to <hi>Windſor,</hi> propoſed to Him a way to eſcape from that bloody Guard that hurried Him to the Slaughter, He rejected it, ſaying, <hi>If I ſhould get away, they would cut you in Pieces;</hi> and therefore would not try their deſign, though it ſeemed feaſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:104649:131"/>With theſe Arts He did ſeek to oblige the Community; but the Faction's Slanders hindred the Succeſs:
<note place="margin">His Obliging Converſe.</note> which they the more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> never affected <hi>Popularity,</hi> for that <hi>conſiſts in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious pleaſing of the People in minute and ordinary Circumſtances;</hi> but He alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by a ſolid Vertue their real Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and therefore in confidence of that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a ſpecious Compliance with the leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial humours of the Vulgar: ſo that the <hi>Multitude,</hi> who <hi>are taken with things of the lighteſt conſideration,</hi> could not ſufficiently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Him, being not able to apprehend His worth: for a <hi>Statist</hi> obſerves, <hi>Moderate Princes are alwayes admired, but Heroick are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi> On particular Perſons (if not the ſworn Creatures of the Conſpirators, and by Treaſon made inhumane) He ſeldom failed by converſing to take them. His Trophies in this kind, even when He was deſpoiled of means to bribe their hopes, were innumerable; and thoſe that engaged againſt Him ere they knew Him, after their knowledge of Him did curſe their Credulity and their proſperous Arms. A clear inſtance of this (to mention no more) was in Maſter <hi>Vines,</hi> one of the Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>As He was powerful to gain, ſo He was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keep Friends.
<note place="margin">His Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> 
               <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the Publick and Private was His chiefeſt Care; for He knew how <hi>neceſſary it is for Princes to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe it is ſo much their Intereſt that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould not be falſe.</hi> Though it is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Empire with other <hi>Kings</hi> to proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Faith to their Advantage, yet He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to promiſe any thing which He could not Religiouſly obſerve. Some over-ſine <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici</hi> would have had Him grant all the Deſires of the Faction, as the moſt immediate way to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104649:132"/>their Ruine; for it was ſuppoſed they could never agree in dividing the Spoil, and their diſſenſions would have opened a way for the recovery of His abandoned Rights. But He was ſo conſtant in all that was good, that He thought the purchaſe of Greatneſs too vile for the breach of His Faith, and He hated thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions which would give Him cauſe to bluſh. This Heroick Expreſſion often fell from Him, <hi>Leave me to My Conſcience and Honour, and let what will befall Me.</hi> His Enemies knew this ſo natural, that if they could make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions repugnant to His Conſcience, they were ſure no Peace ſhould obſtruct their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Nay, He was faithful in thoſe Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein their firſt Breach would have juſtified a departure from His Promiſe; though He ſaw this Vertue would be rewarded with His Murther. For when ſome of His Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> daily importuned Him to provide for His Safety from the perfidious Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Army, which every day they had informations of, He made this return; <hi>Trouble not your ſelves, I have the Parliaments Faith and Honour engaged for My remaining here in Honour, Freedom, and Safety, and I will not diſhonour My ſelf by Eſcaping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As He was to the Publick ſo to His Private Obligations. No aſſaults could take the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> from His Protection: for though His foreign Enterpriſes required ſupplies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104649:133"/>and the Faction would not let the Bills for Subſidies paſs unleſs they might be gratified with the Dukes blood, or Degradation from His Truſt, the <hi>King</hi> would not buy them with the Life or Diſhonour of His Friend. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he fell afterwards as a Sacrifice to the Common hate, (for ſo the Aſſaſſinate pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he might give a Splendor to his Crime, <hi>It being more ſpecious to revenge the Publick than private Injuries,</hi>) yet was he not the <hi>Kings</hi>'s Offering. In the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> this Honour ſeemed to be clouded: But Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will ſee that that Noble Perſon was rather raviſhed from Him, (on deſign by his Enemies to rob him of the Glory of Fidelity,) than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Him; for He never left him till the Earl did abandon himſelf. And a Penitence for a Submiſſion (not Conſent) to the Rape made a Satisfaction for the Offence, and repaired the damage of the Injury. For His Majeſties Tears over him will embalm and preſerve his name and blood to the honour of Following Ages more than the remnant of his dayes would have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to his Glory.</p>
            <p>It would be an Injury to His other Vertues to mention His <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.</note> becauſe it is an Infamy to be otherwiſe; unleſs to let Poſterity know, that no injured Husband nor Diſhonoured Family conſpired to His Ruine, but ſuch who were engaged to Him for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104649:133"/>all their Rights in thoſe Relations unattem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, and ſecuring them by His own example. He witneſſed His Conjugal <hi>Chaſtity</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Death, (a time not to be ſpent in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which was too little for neceſſary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to appear before the God of Truth;) when He commanded the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to tell her Mother, that <hi>His thoughts had never ſtrayed from Her, and His Love ſhould be the ſame to the Laſt.</hi> The purity of His Speech likewiſe teſtified the Cleanneſs of His Heart, for He did abhor all Obſcene and wanton Diſcourſe. And He was ſo far from defiling the Beds, that He would not pollute the Ears of His Subjects.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Chaſtity</hi> found no Aſſaults from Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, for He never fed to Luxury but Health.
<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> His ſtrong Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required large Meals, but His Vertue took care they ſhould not be gluttonous; for He delighted not in Sawces or Artifices to pleaſe the Palate and raiſe the Luſt, but all was ſincere and ſolid, and therefore He never was ſubject to a Surfeit. He alwayes min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Water with His Wine, which He never drank pure but when He eat Veniſon; and He was ſo nice in obſerving the bounds of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,</hi> that moſt times Himſelf would meaſure and mingle both together. He did uſually at every Meal drink one Glaſs of Beer, another of Wine, and a third of Water, and ſeldom
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104649:134"/>drank between His Meals. Theſe though Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Vertues, were yet eminent in Him, ſince they could not be corrupted by the Power not the Flatteries of Fortune. And they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned to gratifie Poſterity; for <hi>men are curious to know all, even the minute Paſſages of Great and Vertuous Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being free from Incontinency and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the gulphs of Treaſure and Drayners of the Largeſt Exchequer,
<note place="margin">His Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</note> He had no other Vice to exhauſt the Publick Stock, and ſo neceſſitate Him to ſill it up by Oppreſſions, but He would by <hi>Frugality</hi> make His Revenue ſufficient for the Majeſty of the Crown, and the Neceſſities of the State. His own Nature indeed inclined Him to Magnificence, but the Vices of others did inſtruct Him to moderate Expences. For He had found the Treaſury low, and the Debts great, in His beginnings: He was aſſaulted with two expenſive Wars from the two great Potentates of <hi>Furope,</hi> and the Faction had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the uſual way of Supplies by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore He was to find a Mine in Vertue; and by ſparing from Vanities, make proviſions for neceſſary and glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, which He did effect: for in that ſhort time of Peace, which He enjoyed, He ſatisfied all the Publick Debts, ſo furniſhed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed His Navy, that it was the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the whole World, ſupported His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104649:134"/>the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and by Money inabled him for the Victories of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſo fill'd His own Treaſury, that it was able of it ſelf to bear the weight of the firſt <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition without the Aids of the Subject, who were never more able to contribute to their own ſafety, nor ever had more reaſon, the ſwellings of that Nation breaking all the Banks and Fences of their Liberty and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the <hi>King</hi> would let them ſee that as by His Government He had made them rich, He would alſo keep them ſo by His Frugality. But thoſe whoſe firſt care was to make Him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, and the next odious, did brand it with the name of Covetouſneſs, which was as Falſe as malicious; For He never ſpared when Juſt Deſigns call'd for Expences, and was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in Noble Undertakings, as in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of <hi>Paul</hi>'s. He was alwayes Gratefull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe men who meaſured their Services not by their Duties, or their Merits, but by their Expectations from His Fortune, thought Him not Liberal. He choſe rather not to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then His People by Subſidies, than load parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Servants with unequal Bounties. For <hi>Good Princes chuſe to be loved rather for their Benefits to the Community than for thoſe to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons. And it may be Vanity and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but not Liberality, when the gifts of the Prince are not proportioned to the Common Neceſſity.</hi> His ſparings were like thoſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Fathers, that His Subjects as Children
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104649:135"/>might have the more. He never, like ſubtle and rapacious Kings, made or pretended a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for Taxes, but was troubled when He found it. The Contributions of Parliament He eſteemed not the increaſe of His peculiar Treaſure, but the Proviſions for the Common Safety, of which He would rather be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Steward than a Lord. When Faction and Sedition ſo deluded the People that they could not ſee the preſervation of the whole conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in contributing ſome ſmall part, He freely parted with His own Inhertance to preſerve intire to them the price of their Sweat and Labour.</p>
            <p>As He had theſe Moral Vertues, which are both the ſignatures of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<note place="margin">His Intellectual Abilities.</note> and the Ornaments of a Royal Spirit, ſo He was no leſs compleat in the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. His Underſtanding was as Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as His Juſt Power, and He was Maſter of more ſorts of Knowledge than He was of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How much He knew of the Myſteries and Controverſies of Divinity was evident in His Diſcourſes and Papers with <hi>Henderſon,</hi> and thoſe at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where He ſingly Diſputed for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> one whole day againſt Fifteen Commiſſioners and their Four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, (the moſt experienced and ſubtle mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all the Oppoſite Party) with ſo much Acuteneſs and Felicity, that even His Oppoſers
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104649:135"/>admired Him. He ſo dexterouſly managed His Diſcourſe with the Miniſters, that He made it evident they perſwaded Him to that which they themſelves judged unlawfull, and had condemned as Sacriledge, when they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſatisfie the Scruples of His Conſcience, and to aſſure Him He might ſafely alienate the Church-Lands. And the Commiſſioners ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how unequal their Miniſters were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Him, for ever after ſilenced them, and permitted no Diſputes but by Papers. At that time He exceeded the opinion of His friends about Him. One of them ſaid in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that <hi>Certainly God had inſpired Him.</hi> Another, that <hi>His Majeſtly was to a Wonder improved by His Privacies and Afflictions.</hi> But a third; that had had the Honour of a nearer Service, aſſured them that the <hi>King was never leſs, only He had now the opportunity of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in His full Magnitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Law of the Land He was as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as Himſelf ſaid to the Parricides, yet was no boaſter of His own Parts) as any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>England,</hi> who did not profeſs the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Practice of it: eſpecially thoſe Parts of it which concerned the Commerce between <hi>King</hi> and People. In that Art which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Princes, <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> He knew as much as the moſt proſperous Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>Kings,</hi> or their moſt exerciſed Miniſters, yet ſcorned to follow thoſe Rules of it which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104649:136"/>lead from the Paths of Juſtice. The Reſerves that other Princes uſed in their Leagues and Contracts, to colour the breaches of Faith, and thoſe inglorious and dark Intrigues of ſubtle Politicians, He did perfectly abhor: but His Letters, Declarations, Speeches, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are full of that Political Wiſdom which is conſiſtent with Chriſtianity. He had ſo quick an Inſight into theſe Myſteries, and ſo early arrived to the Knowledge of it, that when He was young, and had juſt gotten out of the Court and Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> He cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the weakneſs of that Myſterious Council. For He was no ſooner on Shipboard, but the firſt words He ſpake were, <hi>I diſcovered two Errors in thoſe great Maſters of Policy; One that they would uſe Me ſo Ill, and another that after ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage they permitted Me to Depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As thoſe former parts of Knowledge did inable Him to know <hi>Men,</hi> and how to manage their different humours,
<note place="margin">His Skill in all Arts.</note> and to temper them to a ſitneſs for Society, and make them ſerviceable to the Glory of that God whoſe Miniſter He was: ſo His Soul was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a full Knowledge of the Nature of <hi>Things,</hi> and eaſily comprehended almoſt all kinds of Arts that either were for Delight or of a Publick Uſe; for He was ignorant of nothing but of what He thought it became
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104649:136"/>Him to be negligent, (for many parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that are for the Ornament of a Private perſon are beneath the Cares of a Crowned Head.) He was well skilled in things of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, could judge of Meddals whether they had the number of years they pretended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; His Libraries and Cabinets were full of thoſe things on which length of Time put the Value of Rarities. In Painting He had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Fancy, that He would ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Art in the Workman, and ſuddenly draw thoſe Lines, give thoſe Airs and Lights, which Experience and Practice had not taught the Painter. He could judge of Fortifications, and cenſure whether the Cannon were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Execution or no. He had an excellent Skill in Guns, knew all that belonged to their making. The exacteſt Arts of building Ships for the moſt neceſſary uſes of ſtrength or good ſailing, together with all their furniture, were not unknown to Him. He underſtood and was pleaſed with the making of Clocks and Watches. He comprehended the Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There was not any one Gentleman of all the three Kingdoms that could compare with Him in an Univerſality of Knowledge. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged all the Parts of Learning, and He delighted to talk with all kind of Artiſts, and with ſo great a Facility did apprehend the Myſteries of their Profeſſions, that He did ſometime ſay, <hi>He thought He could get His Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if Neceſſitated, by any Trade He knew of,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104649:137"/>but making of Hangings:</hi> although of theſe He underſtood much, and was greatly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; for He brought ſome of the moſt curious Workmen from Foreign Parts to make them here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Writings ſhew what Notions He had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the whole ſtore of Learning,
<note place="margin">His Eloquence.</note> which He cloathed with a Wonderfull and moſt charming <hi>Eloquence.</hi> Which was unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſo great, that thoſe who endeavoured to deſpoil Him of His Civil Dominions granted Him a deſerved Empire among famous Writers. The Book of His Meditations is alone ſufficient to make His Aſſaſſinates execrable to all that in any Age ſhall have a ſenſe of Piety, or a love to Wiſdom and Eloquence. <hi>For ſo great an affection in the Breaſts of men do excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings acquire for their Authors, that though they may be otherwiſe blameable, yet their Works render their Memories precious; and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deaths of ſuch increaſe their Glory, while they load their Murtherers with Ignominy. All men, eſpecially among Poſterity, deeming ſo great Wits could not be cut off but to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Injury, and by Perſons brutiſhly mad, or by ſome horrid ſins debauched to an Enmity with mankind. So that all ſuture times ſhall admire and applaud His Writings againſt them, and curſe their Injuſtice to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:104649:137"/>His Wiſdom was not only Speculative in His Writings, but alſo Practical in His Counſels.
<note place="margin">His Political Prudence.</note> None found out better means for accompliſhing a Deſign, provided ſafer expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents for the Reſſorts of Difficulties, or more clearely foreſaw the Event at a Diſtance; nor were any Counſels ſo proſperous as His own, when they were vigorouſly proſecuted by thoſe whom He intruſted with the Execution; and He ſeldom miſcarried but when He inclined to follow the Advices of others; as He did in that inauſpicious Attempt to take <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> wherein He forſook His own Reaſons, which He urged with all poſſible Evidence of Succeſs, to march towards <hi>London.</hi> He ſaw into the Intrigues of His Enemies; and had not the Treacheries (which being ſecret are above the Caution of Humane Nature) of ſome that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Him opened to them His Deſigns, He had (by the Ordinary Courſe of Providence) covered them with the ſhame both of Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Overthrow. Thoſe Miſeries that the Faction after they got into Power brought upon the Nation, and the Events of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Enterpriſes, were diſcovered and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Him in the very beginnings to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded World, who notwithſtanding were Fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinded to chuſe their own Ruine.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever His Secretaries had drawn up,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104649:138"/>by the Direction of the <hi>Council,</hi> Declarations or any other Papers, and offered them to His peruſal, though both they and the Council had done their parts, yet He would alwayes with His own hand correct them both as to Matter and Form; He commonly uſing theſe words when He took the Pen in His hand, <hi>Come, I am a good Cobler:</hi> and the Corrections were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them all to be both for the greater luſtre and advantage of the Writings. His Inſtructions to His Ambaſſadors, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, Deputies, were ſo full of Wiſdom, and ſuch prudent proviſions for all the Reſſorts of thoſe they were to treat with, that there was nothing to be ſupplyed on their parts to make their Negotiations happy, but ſeaſonable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, or a fortune to deal with reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men. It was the Obſervation of a Noble Perſon (who was dear to Him for his Wiſdom and Faithluineſs, and was of His Council in all His Troubles) that <hi>had the King been a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor to any other Prince, He would have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eſleem of an Oracle,</hi> all His Propoſals being grounded upon the greateſt Reaſon, and proper to the Buſineſs conſulted about. Thoſe that have been forward to interpret His Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Suceeſs, and from thence have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Cenſure of His Prudence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not the numerous Difficulties in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Reſolution, nor the fallacious repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Affairs to Him, but only looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His unproſperous Reſolves according to the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104649:138"/>Fate of unhappy Counſels, which <hi>is to have that condemned which was put in Execution, and that praiſed as beſt which was never try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was He made for Empire as well as born unto it; and had all thoſe Excellencies, which,
<note place="margin">The Cenſure of His Fortune.</note> if we had been free to chuſe, muſt have determined our Election of a Sovereign to Him alone, there being nothing wanting in Him that the ſevereſt Cenſors of Princes do number among the Requiſites of a compleat Monarch. It was therefore the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thoſe who conceive every man to be the Artificer of His own Fortune, how it came to paſs that He had not that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted current of Succeſs (which ſome men reckon among the conſtitutives of Happineſs) in all His Enterpriſes. To Others that impute all our affairs here below to an inviolable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Decrees of Heaven, which yet they acknowledge juſt, though dark, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the Riddles of Providence, that a <hi>King</hi> of ſo great Vertues ſhould yet be cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous: for let Poſterity judge how great and how good this <hi>Prince</hi> was, that could not be ruined even after a <hi>War</hi> (which <hi>uſually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters the Spirits of thoſe that are moleſted by it</hi>) and a total <hi>Overthrow (whoſe common Conſequent is Contempt)</hi> but by ſo various and ſuch wicked Arts; and was judged by all men,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104649:139"/>though He wanted, yet <hi>to deſerve Proſperity (as to humane judgement,)</hi> which (as ſome think) <hi>is the trueſt Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe Doubts there appears no Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo obvious as that into the Pleaſure of the Divine Majeſty, who provoked by our ſins, which had profaned his Mercies, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Peace and Plenty he gave us, would chaſtiſe us by the ſcourge of Civil War, the corrective of too much felicity, and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the beſt of <hi>Kings</hi> leave us to the Pride and Violence of the baſeſt of men. And that it was a wrath directed againſt us was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becauſe the misfortunes and fall of that Incomparable <hi>Prince</hi> opened upon us an avenue for all thoſe miſeries that a Community is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto in the want of a lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while the Almighty ſecured the Glory of the <hi>King</hi> even in His Sufferings, provided for the Support and Honour of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in its loweſt Eſtate, and miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Chief of it from innumerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and made us to ſee afterwards in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Providences, that he had not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his loving-kindneſs from the Houſe of <hi>King CHARLES,</hi> by reſtoring it to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Grandeur.</p>
            <p>And this he was pleaſed to ſignifie to the <hi>King</hi> by a Paſſage that appeared little leſs than a Miracle. For while He was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104649:139"/>the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> now Lord High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of <hi>England,</hi> (a Perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Honour and Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of an eminent Integrity,
<note place="margin">A Preſage of His Fall, and the future State of the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Flattery of Princes, who doth atteſt this Occurrence) as Gentleman of the Bed-chamber lay one Night in the ſame Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with Him, the Wax <hi>Mortar,</hi> which according to Cuſtom the <hi>King</hi> alwayes had in His Chamber, was in the night, as they both conceived and took notice of it, fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. But my Lord riſing in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found it lighted, and ſaid to the <hi>KING, Sir, this Mortar now burns very clearly:</hi> at which they both exceedingly wondred, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluding it had been out in the Night, and they could not imagine how any of the Grooms, or any other could poſſibly light it, the Door being locked with a Spring within. This buſying the wonder of both for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the <hi>King</hi> afterwards when He ſaw the Malice of His Enemies preſs hard upon His Life and Ruine, reflecting upon this Occurrence, drew it into this Preſage, <hi>That though God would permit His Light to be extinguiſhed for a time, yet He would at laſt light it again;</hi> which was verified in the Event: for though God ſuffered the Faction to ſpill His blood, yet after many years of Troubles, and when he had permitted thoſe Monſters to bring us to the brinks of deſtruction, he reſtored His Son
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104649:140"/>to the Crown in as much Splendour and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as any of His Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>As His Abliities for the Publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government were all apt to raiſe Admiration;
<note place="margin">His Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſo His Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and Privacies gave a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſuch as communicated in the ſight of them, and there needed no more to beget an Honour of Him than to behold Him in His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, which were all ſerious, and there was no part of His time which either wanted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, or deſerved not Commendation. In His younger dayes, His pleaſures were in Riding, and ſometimes in breaking the great Horſe; and He did it ſo gracefully, that He deſerved that Statue of Braſs which did repreſent Him on Horſe-back. Beſides this, He delighted in Hunting, an active and ſtirring Exerciſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom Him to toils, and harden that body whoſe mind abhorred the ſoftneſs of <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Eaſe,</hi> which <hi>Vicious Princes think a part of Power and the Rewards of Publick Cares:</hi> but He uſed this as the way whereby the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Heroes were habituated to Labours, and by contending with ſome beaſts in Strength and others in Swiftneſs, firſt to rout, then to chaſe their flying Enemies. When the ſeaſon of the year did not permit this ſport, then Tennis, Gough, Bowls were the wayes of His Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in all theſe He was wonderfully active and excellent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:104649:140"/>His ſofter pleaſures were Books, and of His time ſpent in theſe there were many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In His Library at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s there was kept a Collection of His, of the excellent Sayings of Authors, written with His own hand, and in his Youth, preſented to His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>King JAMES:</hi> and there is yet extant in the hands of a Worthy Perſon, His Extracts written with His own hand, out of My Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> of all the Arguments againſt the Papiſts, digeſted into ſo excellent a Method, that He gave Light and Strength to them even while He did epitomiſe them into a ſheet or two of Paper. The ſame Care and Pains He had beſtowed in reading the moſt Judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the Learned Works of Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> out of all which He had gathered whatſoever was excellent in them, and fitted them for His ready uſe. When He was tired with Reading, then He applyed Himſelf to Diſcourſe, wherein He both bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited Himſelf and others; and He was good at the Relation of a Story, or telling of an Occurrence. When theſe were tedious by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, He would either play at Cheſs, or pleaſe Himſelf with His Pictures, of which He had many choice pieces of the beſt Maſters, as <hi>Titian, Rafael, Tintoret</hi> and others, with which He had adorned His moſt frequented Palaces, as alſo with moſt antique pieces of Sculpture; ſo that to thoſe that had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104649:141"/>it ſeemed that <hi>Italy</hi> was Tranſlated to His Court.</p>
            <p>As His Spirit was thus accompliſhed, ſo His Body had its Elegancies. His Stature was of a juſt height,
<note place="margin">The Features of His Body.</note> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decent than tall; His Body erect, and not enclining to a Corpulency, nor meager, till His Afflictions wrought too ſtrongly upon it to a Leanneſs; His Limbs exactly proportioned, His Face full of Majeſty, and His Brow large and Fair: His Eyes ſo quick and piercing, that they went farther than the Superficies of men, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their more Inward parts; for at the firſt ſight He would paſs a judgment upon the frame of a Man's Spirit and Faculties, and He was not often miſtaken, having a ſtrange hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in Phyſiognomy, and by reaſon of this He would remember any one He had ſeen but once many years after. His Complexion was enclining to a Paleneſs, His Hair a brown, which He wore of a moderate length, ending in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and eaſie curles: upon His left ſide He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged one Lock to a greater length in the youthful part of His Life. His Beard He wore picqued, but after the Faction had paſſed thoſe <hi>Votes of No Addreſſes,</hi> He permitted it to grow neglectedly and to cover more of His face. His Geſtures had nothing of affectation, but full of Majeſtick Gravity. His motions were ſpeedy, and His gate faſt: which ſhewed the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104649:141"/>Alacrity and Vigour of His Mind, for His Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were temperate. He was of a moſt healthfull Conſtitution, and after the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of His Childhood was never ſick. Once He had the ſmall Pox, but the Malignity of it was ſo ſmall, that it altered not His Stomach, nor put Him to the abſtinence of one Meal, neither did it detain Him above a fortnight under the Care of His Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>He was the Father of Four Sons and Five Daughters.

               <p>WHen Providence was pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Me of all other civil Comforts and ſecular Attendants, I thought the abſence of them all might beſt be ſupplyed by the attendance of ſome of my Chaplains; whom for their Function I reverence, and for their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity I have cauſe to love. By their Learning, Piety and Prayers, I hoped to be either better enabled to ſuſtain the want of all other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or better fitted for the recovery and uſe of them in God's good time: ſo reaping by their Pious help a ſpiritual harveſt of Grace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104649:144"/>the thorns, and after the plowings of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Croſſes.</p>
               <p>The truth is, I never needed or deſired more the ſervice and aſſiſtance of men judiciouſly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſoberly Devout.</p>
               <p>The Solitude they have confined Me unto adds the Wilderneſs to my Temptations: For the company they obtrude upon Me is more ſad than any Solitude can be.</p>
               <p>If I had asked my Revenues, my Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or any one of my Kingdoms, it had been no wonder to have been denied in thoſe things, where the evil Policy of Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all juſt reſtitution, leſt they ſhould confeſs an injurious Uſurpation: But to deny Me the Ghoſtly comfort of my Chaplains, ſeems a greater Rigor and Barbarity than is ever uſed by Chriſtians to the meaneſt Priſoners and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Malefactors; whom though the Juſtice of the Law deprives of worldly comforts, yet the Mercy of Religion allows them the benefit of their Clergy, as not aiming at once to deſtroy their Bodies, and to damn their Souls.</p>
               <p>But My Agony muſt not be relieved with the preſence of any one good Angel; for ſuch I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a Learned, Godly, and diſcreet Divine: and ſuch I would have all mine to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:104649:145"/>They that envy my being a King, are loth I ſhould be a Chriſtian; while they ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Me of all things elſe, they are afraid I ſhould ſave my Soul.</p>
               <p>Other ſence Charity it ſelf can hardly pick out of thoſe many harſh Repulſes I received, as to that Requeſt ſo often made for the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſome of my Chaplains.</p>
               <p>I have ſometime thought, the Unchriſtianneſs of thoſe denials might ariſe from a diſpleaſure ſome men had to ſee Me prefer My own Divines before their Miniſters: whom though I reſpect for that worth and piety which may be in them; yet I cannot think them ſo proper for My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Comforters or Phyſicians, who have (ſome of them at leaſt) had ſo great an influence in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning theſe Calamities, and inflicting theſe Wounds upon Me.</p>
               <p>Nor are the ſobereſt of them ſo apt for that Devotional compliance and juncture of hearts, which I deſire to bear in thoſe holy Offices to be performed with Me and for Me; ſince their Judgements ſtanding at a diſtance from Me, or in jealouſie of Me, or in oppoſition againſt Me, their Spirits cannot ſo harmoniouſly accord with Mine, or Mine with theirs, either in Prayer or other holy Duties, as is meet and moſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; whoſe golden Rule and bond of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104649:145"/>conſiſts in that of mutual Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Some Remedies are worſe than the Diſeaſe, and ſome Comforters more miſerable than Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſelf: when, like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, they ſeek not to fortifie ones mind with Patience, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man, by betraying his own Innocency, to deſpair of God's Mercy; and by juſtifying their Injuries, to ſtrengthen the hands and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the hearts of Inſolent Enemies.</p>
               <p>I am ſo much a friend to all Church-men that have any thing in them beſeeming that Sacred Function, that I have hazarded My own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt chiefly upon Conſcience and Conſtancy to maintain their Rights: whom the more I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Orphans, and under the Sacrilegious eyes of many cruel and rapacious Reformers; the more I thought it my duty to appear as a Father and a Patron for them and the Church. Although I am very unhandſomly requited by ſome of them, who may live to repent no leſs for My Sufferings than their own ungrateful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and that injurious Contempt and Meanneſs which they have brought upon their Calling and Perſons.</p>
               <p>I pity all of them, I deſpiſe none: only I thought I might have leave to make choice of ſome for my ſpecial Attendants, who were beſt approved in My Judgement, and moſt ſuitable
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104649:146"/>to My Affection. For I held it better to ſeem undevout, and to hear no mens Prayers, than to be forced, or ſeem to comply with thoſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which the Heart cannot conſent, nor the Tongue ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> without contradicting a mans own Underſtanding, or belying his own Soul.</p>
               <p>In Devotions I love neither Profane Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor Pious Nonſenſe; but ſuch an humble and judicious Gravity, as ſhews the Speaker to be at once conſiderate of God's Majeſty, the Churches Honour, and his own Vileneſs; both knowing what things God allows him to ask, and in what manner it becomes a Sinner to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the Divine Mercy for himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I am equally ſcandalized with all Prayers that ſound either imperiouſly, or rudely, or paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; as either wanting Humility to God, or Charity to Men, or Reſpect to the Duty.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I am better pleaſed, as with ſtudied and premeditated Sermons, ſo with ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Forms of Prayer as are fitted to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and every Chriſtians daily and common neceſſities: becauſe I am by them better aſſured what I may joyn my Heart unto, than I can be of any mans Extemporary ſufficiency; which as I do not wholly exclude from publick occaſions, ſo I allow its juſt liberty and uſe in private and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104649:146"/>devout retirements, where neither the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Duty, nor the modeſt regard to others, do require ſo great exactneſs as to the outward manner of performance. Though the light of Underſtanding, and the fervency of Affection, I hold the main and moſt neceſſary requiſites both in conſtant and occaſional, ſolitary and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Devotions.</p>
               <p>So that I muſt needs ſeem to all equal minds, with as much Reaſon to prefer the ſervice of My own Chaplains before that of their Miniſters, as I do the Liturgy before the Directory.</p>
               <p>In the one I have been alwayes educated and exerciſed; in the other I am not yet Catechiſed nor acquainted: And if I were, yet ſhould I not by that, as by any certain Rule and Canon of Devotion, be able to follow or find out the indirect extravagancies of moſt of thoſe men who highly cry up that as a piece of rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and uſe, which is already as much deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſuſed by many of them, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer ſometimes was by thoſe men, a great part of whoſe piety hung upon that popular pin of railing againſt and contemning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Liturgy of this Church. But I had rather be condemned to the woe of <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> than to that of <hi>Vae vobis, Hypocritae,</hi> by ſeeming to pray what I do not approve.</p>
               <p>It may be, I am eſteemed by my Deniers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104649:147"/>of My ſelf to diſcharge my Duty to God as a Prieſt, though not to Men as a Prince.</p>
               <p>Indeed I think both Offices, Regal and Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal, might well become the ſame Perſon; as anciently they were under one name, and the united rights of primogeniture: Nor could I follow better precedents, if I were able, than thoſe two eminent Kings, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> not more famous for their Scepters and Crowns, than one was for devout Pſalms and Prayers, the other for his divine Parables and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whence the one merited and aſſumed the name of a Prophet, the other of a Preacher. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles indeed of greater honour, where rightly placed, than any of thoſe the Roman Emperours affected from the Nations they ſubdued; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely more glorious to convert Souls to Gods Church by the Word, than to conquer men to a ſubjection by the Sword.</p>
               <p>Yet ſince the order of Gods Wiſdom and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath, for the moſt part, alwayes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Gifts and Offices of Kings and Prieſts, of Princes and Preachers, both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches; I am ſorry to find My ſelf reduced to the neceſſity of being both, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying neither.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as ſeek to deprive Me of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power and Soveraignty, would no leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Me to live many months without all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104649:147"/>Sacraments and Sermons, unleſs I become My own Chaplain.</p>
               <p>As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian KING, ſo I deſire to enjoy from them the benefit of their Gifts and Prayers; which I look upon as more prevalent than My own or other mens, by how much they flow from Minds more enlightned and Affections leſs diſtracted than thoſe which are encumbred with Secular affairs: beſides, I think a greater Bleſſing and acceptableneſs attends thoſe Duties, which are rightly performed, as proper to and within the limits of that Calling to which God and the Church have ſpecially deſigned and conſecrated ſome men. And however, as to that Spiritual Government by which the Devout Soul is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Chriſt, and through his Merits daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf and its ſervices to God, every private Believer is a King and a Prieſt, inveſted with the honour of a Royal Prieſthood; yet as to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Order, and the outward Polity of the Church, I think confuſion in Religion will as certainly follow every mans turning Prieſt or Preacher, as it will in the State where every one affects to rule as King.</p>
               <p>I was alwayes bred to more modeſt, and, I think, more Pious Principles: The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my Spiritual defects makes Me more prize and deſire thoſe Pious aſſiſtances which holy and good Miniſters, either Biſhops or Presbyters,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104649:148"/>may afford Me; eſpecially in theſe Extremities to which God hath been pleaſed to ſuffer ſome of my Subjects to reduce Me, ſo as to leave them nothing more but my Life to take from Me; and to leave Me nothing to deſire, which I thought might leſs provoke their Jealouſie and offence to deny Me than this, of having ſome means afforded Me for my Souls comfort and ſupport.</p>
               <p>To which end I made choice of men, as no way (that I know) ſcandalous, ſo every way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for their Learning and Piety, no leſs than for their Loyalty: nor can I imagine any exceptions to be made againſt them but only this, That they may ſeem too able, and too well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected toward Me and my Service.</p>
               <p>But this is not the firſt ſervice (as I count it the beſt) in which they have forced Me to ſerve My ſelf: though I muſt confeſs, I bear with more grief and impatience the want of my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains than of any other my Servants, and next (if not beyond in ſome things) to the being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from my Wife and Children; fince from theſe indeed more of humane and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Affections, but from thoſe more of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Eternal Improvements may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>My comfort is, that in the enforced (not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) want of ordinary means, God is wont
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104649:148"/>to afford extraordinary ſupplyes of his Gifts and Graces.</p>
               <p>If his Spirit will teach Me, and help my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in Prayer, Reading and Meditation, (as I hope he will) I ſhall need no other either Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Inſtructor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To thee therefore, O My God, do I direct my now ſolitary Prayers: What I want of others help, ſupply with the more immediate aſſiſtances of thy Spirit, which alone can both enlighten my darkneſs, and quicken my dulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O thou Sun of Righteouſneſs, thou Sacred Fountain of Heavenly Light and Heat, at once clear and warm my Heart, both by inſtructing of Me, and interceding for Me.

Thou art company enough, and comfort enough: Thou art my King, be alſo my Prophet and my Prieſt. Rule Me, teach Me, pray in Me, for Me, and be Thou ever with Me.</hi>

               <p>AM I thus laid aſide? and muſt I not ſpeak for My ſelf? No: I will ſpeak, and that to all My People, (which I would have rather done by the way of My two Houſes of Parliament, but that there is a publick Order, neither to make Addreſſes to, or receive Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from me.) And who but you can be judge of the differences betwixt Me and My two Houſes? I know none elſe: for I am ſure you it is who will enjoy the Happineſs, or feel the Miſery of good or ill Government; and we all pretend who ſhould run faſteſt to ſerve you, without having a regard (at leaſt in the firſt place) to particular Intereſts. And therefore I deſire you to conſider the ſtate I am and have
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104649:154"/>been in this long time, and whether My Actions have more tended to the Publick or My own particular good. For whoſoever will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Me barely as I am a Man, without that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which the meaneſt of My Subjects enjoyes) of going whither, and converſing with whom I will; as a Husband and Father, without the comfort of My Wife and Children; or laſtly as a King, without the leaſt ſhew of Authority or Power to protect My diſtreſſed Subjects; muſt conclude Me not only void of all Natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but alſo to want common underſtanding, if I ſhould not moſt chearfully embrace the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way to the ſettlement of theſe diſtracted Kingdoms. As alſo on the other ſide, do but conſider the form and draught of the Bills late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented unto Me, and as they are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a Treaty, ye will conclude, that the ſame Spirit which hath ſtill been able to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all My ſincere and conſtant endeavours for Peace, hath had a powerfull influence on this Meſſage. For though I was ready to grant the ſubſtance, and comply with what they ſeem to deſire; yet as they had framed it, I could not agree thereunto, without deeply wounding My Conſcience and Honour, and betraying the Truſt repoſed in Me, by abandoning My People to the Arbitrary and Unlimited Power of the two Houſes for ever, for the levying and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Land or Sea Forces, without diſtinction of quality or limitation for Money taxes. And if I could have paſſed them in terms, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104649:154"/>a Condition were it for a Treaty to grant beforehand the moſt conſiderable part of the ſubject matter? How ineffectual were that debate like to prove, wherein the moſt potent Party had nothing of moment left to ask, and the other nothing more to give? ſo, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, how hopeleſs of mutual compliance? without which a ſettlement is impoſſible. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if after My Conceſſions the two Houſes ſhould inſiſt on thoſe things from which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depart, how deſperate would the condition of theſe Kingdoms be, when the moſt proper and approved remedy ſhould become ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual? Being therefore fully reſolved that I could neither in Conſcience, Honour or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, paſs thoſe Four Bills; I only endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the Reaſons and Juſtice of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial appear to all the World, as they do to me, intending to give as little diſ-ſatisfaction to the two Houſes of Parliament (without betraying My own Cauſe) as the matter would bear: I was deſirous to give My Anſwer of the 28. of <hi>December</hi> laſt to the Commiſſioners ſealed, (as I had done others heretofore, and ſometimes at the deſire of the Commiſſioners) chiefly, becauſe when My Meſſages or Anſwers were publickly known before they were read in the Houſes, prejudicial interpretations were forced on them, much differing, and ſometimes contrary to My meaning. For example, My Anſwer from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court</hi> was accuſed of dividing the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe I promiſed to give ſatisfaction to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104649:155"/>the <hi>Scots</hi> in all things concerning that Kingdom: And this laſt ſuffers in a contrary ſenſe, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Me intend to intereſt <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Laws of this Kingdom, (than which nothing was, nor is, further from My thoughts) becauſe I took notice of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bills and Propoſitions, as contrary to the Intereſts and Engagements of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Indeed, if I had not mentioned their diſſent, an Objection, not without ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, might have been made againſt Me, both in reſpect the <hi>Scots</hi> are much concern'd in the Bill for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and in ſeveral other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; and My ſilence might, with ſome Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, have ſeemed to approve of it: But the Commiſſioners refuſing to receive My Anſwer ſealed, I (upon the engagement of their and the Governours Honour, that no other uſe ſhould be made or notice taken of it than as if it had not been ſeen) read and delivered it open unto them; whereupon what hath ſince paſſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Governour, in diſcharging moſt of My Servants, redoubling the Guards, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Me of My former Liberty, (and all this, as himſelf confeſt, meerly out of his own diſlike of My Anſwer, notwithſtanding his beforeſaid Engagement) or afterwards by the two Houſes, (as the Governour affirms) in confining Me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circuit of this Caſtle, I appeal to God and the World, whether My ſaid Anſwer deſerved the reply of ſuch proceedings; beſides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs for Subjects to impriſon their King,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104649:155"/>That by the permiſſion of Almighty God I am reduced to this ſad condition, as I no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine; ſo I am not without hope, but that the ſame God will in due time convert theſe Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions into My advantage. In the mean time, I am confident to bear theſe croſſes with Patience, and a great Equality of Mind. But by what means or occaſion I am come to this Relapſe in My Affairs, I am utterly to ſeek; eſpecially when I conſider, that I have ſacrificed to My two Houſes of Parliament, for the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all but what is much more dear to Me than My Life, My Conſcience and Honour; deſiring nothing more than to perform it in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural way, a Perſonal Treaty. But that which makes Me moſt at a loſs is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring My ſignal compliance with the Army and their Intereſts: and of what importance My compliance was to them, and their often-repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Profeſſions and Ingagements for my juſt Rights in general, at <hi>Newmarket</hi> and S. <hi>Albans,</hi> and their particular explanation of thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals by their voted and re-voted Propoſals, which I had reaſon to underſtand ſhould be the utmoſt extremity would be expected from Me, and that in ſome things therein I ſhould be eaſed; (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appealing to the Conſciences of ſome of the chiefeſt Officers in the Army, if what I have ſaid be not punctually true) and how I have failed of their expectations, or My profeſſions to them, I challenge them and the whole World to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the leaſt colour of Reaſon. And now I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104649:156"/>would know what it is that is deſired. Is it Peace? I have ſhewed the way, (being both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to perform my part in it) which is, a juſt compliance with all chief Intereſts. Is it Plenty and Happineſs? They are the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of Peace. Is it Security? I, who wiſh that all men would forgive and forget like Me, have offered the <hi>Militia</hi> for My time. Is it Liberty of Conſcience? He who wants it is moſt ready to give it. Is it the right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice? Officers of truſt are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the choice of My two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is it frequent Parliaments? I have legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fully concurr'd therewith. Is it the Arrears of the Army? Upon a ſettlement they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be paid with much eaſe, but before there will be found much difficulty, if not impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in it.</p>
               <p>Thus all the World cannot but ſee My real and unwearied endeavours for Peace, the which (by the grace of God) I ſhall neither repent Me of nor ever be ſlackned in, notwithſtanding My paſt, preſent, or future ſufferings: But if I may not be heard, let every one judge who it is that obſtructs the good I would or might do. What is it that men are afraid to hear from Me? It cannot be Reaſon, (at leaſt, none will declare themſelves ſo unreaſonable as to confeſs it:) and it can leſs be impertinent or unreaſonable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; for thereby, peradventure, I might more juſtifie this My Reſtraint than the cauſers
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104649:156"/>themſelves can do: ſo that of all wonders yet this is the greateſt to Me. But it may be eaſily gathered how thoſe men intend to govern who have uſed Me thus. And if it be My hard Fate to fall together with the Liberty of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I ſhall not bluſh for My ſelf, but much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the future Miſeries of My People, the which I ſhall ſtill pray to God to avert, whatever becomes of Me.</p>

               <p>AS I have leiſure enough, ſo I have cauſe more than enough to meditate upon, and prepare for my Death; for I know there are but few ſteps between the Priſons and Graves of Princes.</p>
               <p>It is God's indulgence which gives Me the ſpace, but Mans Cruelty that gives Me the ſad occaſions for theſe thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:104649:157"/>For, beſides the common burthen of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which lies upon Me as a Man, I now bear the heavy load of other mens Ambitions, Fears, Jealouſies, and cruel Paſſions, whoſe Envy or Enmity againſt Me makes their own lives ſeem deadly to them, while I enjoy any part of Mine.</p>
               <p>I thank God, my Proſperity made Me not wholly a ſtranger to the contemplations of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: Thoſe are never unſeaſonabble, ſince this is alwayes uncertain: Death being an Eclipſe which oft happeneth as well in clear as cloudy dayes.</p>
               <p>But my now long and ſharp Adverſity hath ſo reconciled in Me thoſe natural Antipathies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Life and Death which are in all men, that, I thank God, the common terrours of it are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and the ſpecial horrour of it as to My particular much allayed: for although my Death at preſent may juſtly be repreſented to Me with all thoſe terrible aggravations which the policy of Cruel and Implacable enemies can put upon it (affairs being drawn to the very dregs of Malice;) yet, I bleſs God, I can look upon all thoſe ſtings as unpoiſonous, though ſharp, ſince my Redeemer hath either pulled them out, or given Me the Antidote of his Death againſt them; which as to the Immatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Unjuſtice, Shame, Scorn and Cruelty of it, exceeded whatever I can fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:104649:157"/>Indeed, I never did find ſo much the Life of Religion, the Feaſt of a good Conſcience, and the brazen wall of a judicious Integrity and Conſtancy, as ſince I came to theſe cloſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with the thoughts of Death.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo old as to be weary of Life; nor (I hope) ſo bad as to be either afraid to dye, or aſhamed to live: true, I am ſo afflicted, as might make Me ſometime even deſire to dye; if I did not conſider, that it is the greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Chriſtians life to <hi>dye daily,</hi> in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a lively Faith and patient Hopes of a better life, thoſe partial and quotidian deaths which kill us (as it were) by piece-meals, and make us overlive our own fates; while we are deprived of Health, Honour, Liberty, Power, Credit, Safety or Eſtate, and thoſe other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of deareſt Relations, which are as the Life of our lives.</p>
               <p>Though, as a KING, I think My ſelf to live in nothing temporal ſo much as in the Love and good will of my People; for which as I have ſuffered many deaths, ſo I hope I am not in that point as yet wholly dead: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Enemies have uſed all the poiſon of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and violence of Hoſtility to deſtroy, firſt the Love and Loyalty which is in my Subjects, and then all that content of Life in Me which from theſe I chiefly enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:104649:158"/>Indeed, they have left Me but little of Life, and only the husk and ſhell (as it were) which their further Malice and Cruelty can take from Me; having bereaved Me of all thoſe worldly Comforts for which Life it ſelf ſeems deſirable to men.</p>
               <p>But, O my Soul, think not that Life too long or tedious wherein God gives Thee any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, if not to do, yet to ſuffer with ſuch Chriſtian Patience and Magnanimity in a good Cauſe, as are the greateſt Honour of our Lives, and the beſt improvement of our Deaths.</p>
               <p>I know that in point of true Chriſtian Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it argues Puſillanimity to deſire to dye out of wearineſs of life, and a want of that heroick greatneſs of ſpirit which becomes a Chriſtian, in the patient and generous ſuſtaining thoſe Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which as ſhadows neceſſarily attend us while we are in this Body, and which are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened or enlarged as the Sun of our Proſperity moves higher or lower; whoſe total abſence is beſt recompenced with the dew of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The aſſaults of Affliction may be terrible, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Lion, but they yield much ſweetneſs to thoſe that dare to encounter and overcome them; who know how to overlive the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Gourds without diſcontent or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, while they may yet converſe with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:104649:158"/>That I muſt dye as a Man is certain: that I may dye a King by the hands of my own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a violent, ſudden and barbarous death, in the ſtrength of my years, in the midſt of my Kingdoms, my Friends and loving Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helpleſs Spectators, my Enemies inſolent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers and Triumphers over Me, living, dying, and dead, is ſo probable in humane reaſon, that God hath taught Me not to hope otherwiſe as to mans Cruelty; however I deſpair not of God's infinite Mercy.</p>
               <p>I know my Life is the object of the Devils and Wicked mens Malice; but yet under God's ſole cuſtody and diſpoſal: whom I do not think to flatter for longer Life, by ſeeming prepared to die; but I humbly deſire to depend upon him, and to ſubmit to his will both in life and death, in what order ſoever he is pleaſed to lay them out to Me.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is not eaſie for Me to contend with thoſe many horrors of Death wherewith God ſuffers Me to be tempted; which are equally horrid either in the ſuddenneſs of a barbarous Aſſaſſination, or in thoſe greater formalities whereby my Enemies (being more ſolemnly cruel) will, it may be, ſeek to add (as thoſe did who crucified Chriſt) the Mockery of Juſtice to the Cruelty of Malice. That I may be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as with greater Pomp and Artifice, ſo with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104649:159"/>leſs Pity, it will be but a neceſſary policy, to make my Death appear as an act of Juſtice done by Subjects upon their Soveraign; who know that no Law of God or Man inveſts them with any power of Judicature without Me, much leſs againſt Me; and who, being ſworn and bound by all that is Sacred before God and Man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour my Preſervation, muſt pretend Juſtice to cover their Perjury.</p>
               <p>It is, indeed, a ſad fate for any man to have his Enemies to be his Accuſers, Parties and Judges; but moſt deſperate, when this is acted by the inſolence of Subjects againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; wherein thoſe who have had the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hand, and are moſt guilty of contriving the publick Troubles, muſt by ſhedding My Blood ſeem to waſh their own hands of that innocent blood whereof they are now moſt evidently guilty before God and Man, and, I believe, in their own Conſciences too; while they carried on unreaſonable demands, firſt by Tumults, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Armies. Nothing makes mean ſpirits more cowardly-cruel in managing their uſurped Power againſt their lawfull Superious than this, the <hi>Guilt of their unjust <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe ſpecious and popular pretenſions of Juſtice againſt Delinquents, applyed only to diſguiſe at firſt the monſtrouſneſs of their deſigns, who deſpaired, indeed, of poſſeſſing the power and profits of the Vineyard, till the Heir, whoſe right it is, be caſt out and ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:104649:159"/>With them my greateſt Fault muſt be, that I would not either deſtroy My ſelf, with the Church and State, by my Word, or not ſuffer them to do it unreſiſted by the Sword; whoſe covetous Ambition no Conceſſions of Mine could ever yet either ſatisfie or abate.</p>
               <p>Nor is it likely they will ever think that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Brambles, which ſome men ſeek to erect (at once, weak, ſharp, and fruitleſs either to God or Man) is like to thrive, till watered with the Royal Blood of thoſe whoſe right the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is.</p>

               <p>Nor will he ſuffer thoſe men long to proſper in their <hi>Babel,</hi> who build it with the Bones, and cement it with the Blood of their KINGS.</p>
               <p>I am confident they will find Avengers of my

                  </gap> than by ſhedding theirs who with them moſt thirſted after Mine.</p>
               <p>The ſad Confuſions following my Deſtruction are already preſaged and confirmed to Me by thoſe I have lived to ſee ſince my Troubles, in which God alone (who only could) hath many wayes pleaded my Cauſe; not ſuſtering them to go unpuniſhed whoſe Confederacy in Sin was their only Security; who have cauſe to fear that God will both further divide, and by murual Vengeance afterward deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>My greateſt conqueſt of Death is from the Power and Love of Chriſt, who hath ſwallow'd up Death in the Victory of his Reſurrection and the glory of his Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>My next Comfort is, that he gives Me not only the honour to imitate his Example <hi>in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> (though obſcured by the fouleſt charges of Tyranny and Injuſtice) but alſo that Charity, which is the nobleſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon and Victory over my Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; by which, I thank God, I can both forgive
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104649:160"/>them, and pray for them, that God would not impute my Blood to them, further than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them what need they have of Chriſts Blood to waſh their Souls from the guilt of ſhedding Mine.</p>
               <p>At preſent, the Will of my Enemies ſeems to be their only rule, their Power the meaſure, and their Succeſs the exactor of what they pleaſe to call Juſtice; while they flatter themſelves with the fancy of their own Safety by My Danger, and the ſecurity of their Lives and Deſigns by My Death: forgetting, that as the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to Sin are wrapped up in ſeeming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities, ſo the ſevereſt Vengeances of God are then moſt accompliſhed when men are ſuffered to compleat their wicked purpoſer.</p>
               <p>I bleſs God, I pray not ſo much that this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup of a Violent Death may paſs from Me, as that of his Wrath may paſs from all thoſe whoſe hands by deſerting me are ſprinkled, or by acting and conſenting to my Death are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with my Blood.</p>
               <p>The Will of God hath confined and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mine; I ſhall have the pleaſure of dying, without any pleaſure of deſired Vengeance.</p>
               <p>This I think becomes a Chriſtian toward his Enemies, and a King toward his Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:104649:161"/>They cannot deprive Me of more than I am content to loſe, when God ſees fit by their hands to take it from Me; whoſe Mercy, I believe, will more than infinitely recompence whatever by Mans Injuſtice he is pleaſed to deprive me of.</p>
               <p>The Glory attending my Death will far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all I could enjoy or conceive in Life.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not want the heavy and envied Crowns of this world, when my God hath mercifully crowned and conſummated his Graces with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and exchanged the ſhadows of my Earthly Kingdoms among men, for the ſubſtance of that Heavenly Kingdom with Himſelf.</p>
               <p>For the cenſures of the world, I know the ſharp and neceſſary Tyranny of my Deſtroyers will ſufficiently confute the Calumnies of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny againſt Me: I am perſwaded I am happy in the judicious Love of the ableſt and beſt of my Subjects, who do not only pity and pray for Me, but would be content even to die with Me or for Me.</p>
               <p>Theſe know how to excuſe my Failings as a Man, and yet to retain and pay their Duty to Me as their KING; there being no Religious neceſſity binding any Subjects, by pretending to puniſh, infinitely to exceed the faults and errours of their Princes, eſpecially there where
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:104649:161"/>more than ſufficient Satisfaction hath been made to the publick; the enjoyment of which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Ambitions have hitherto fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Others, I believe, of ſofter tempers, and leſs advantaged by my Ruine, do already feel ſharp Convictions, and ſome remorſe in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; where they cannot but ſee the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their evil dealings againſt Me in the meaſure of God's retaliations upon them, who cannot hope long to enjoy their own thumbs and toes, having under pretence of paring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nails been ſo cruel as to cut off their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of the more inſolent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate may be like that of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices (at once mutining againſt both Prince and Prieſt) in ſuch a method of Divine Juſtice as is not ordinary; the Earth of the loweſt and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt People opening upon them, and ſwallowing them up in a juſt diſdain of their ill-gotten and worſe-uſed Authority, upon whoſe ſupport and ſtrength they chiefly depended for their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſtabliſhing their Deſigns againſt Me, the Church, and State.</p>
               <p>My chiefeſt comfort in Death conſiſts in my Peace which, I truſt, is made with God; before whoſe exact Tribunal I ſhall not fear to appear as to the Cauſe ſo long diſputed by the Sword between Me and my cauſleſs Enemies: where I
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:104649:162"/>doubt not but his Righteous Judgement will confute their Fallacy, who from worldly Succeſs (rather like Sophiſters than ſound Chriſtians) draw thoſe popular Concluſions for God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their actions; whoſe wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (we know) oft permits many events which his revealed Word (the only clear, ſafe and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rule of good Actions and good Conſciences) in no ſort approves.</p>
               <p>I am confident, the Juſtice of my Cauſe and Clearneſs of my Conſcience before God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my People will carry Me as much above them in God's deciſion, as their Succeſſes have lifted them above Me in the Vulgar Opinion: who conſider not that many times thoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of men are lifted up to Heaven in the proſperity and applauſe of the world, whoſe riſe is from Hell as to the Injuriouſneſs and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Deſign. The proſperous winds which oft fill the ſails of Pirats, do not juſtifie their Piracy and Rapine.</p>
               <p>I look upon it with infinite more content and quiet of Soul, to have been worſted in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Conteſtation for and Vindication of the Laws of the Land, the Freedom and Honour of Parliaments, the Rights of my Crown, the juſt Liberty of my Subjects, and the true Chriſtian Religion in its Doctrine, Government and due Encouragements, than if I had with the greateſt advantages of Succeſs over-born them all; as
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104649:162"/>ſome men have now evidently done, what-ever Deſigns they at firſt pretended.</p>
               <p>The Prayers and Patience of my Friends and loving Subjects will contribute much to the ſweetning of this bitter Cup, which I doubt not but I ſhall more chearfully take, and drink as from God's hand, (if it muſt be ſo) than they can give it to Me whoſe hands are unjuſtly and barbarouſly lifted up againſt Me.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt event, I may ſeem to owe more to my Enemies than my Friends; while thoſe will put a period to the Sins and Sorrows attending this miſerable Life, wherewith theſe deſire I might ſtill contend.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be more than Conquerour through Chriſt enabling Me, for whom I have hitherto ſuffered, as he is the Author of Truth, Order and Peace; for all which I have been forced to contend againſt Errour, Faction and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>If I muſt ſuffer a Violent Death, with my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, it is but Mortality crowned with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom: where the debt of Death which I owe for Sin to Nature, ſhall be raiſed as a gift of Faith and Patience offered to God.</p>
               <p>Which I humbly beſeech him mercifully to accept: and although Death be the wages of My own Sin as from God, and the effect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104649:163"/>Sins as men, both againſt God and Me; yet as I hope My own Sins are ſo remitted that they ſhall be no ingredients to imbitter the cup of my Death, ſo I deſire God to pardon their Sins who are moſt guilty of my Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Trophees of my Charity will be more glorious and durable over them, than their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed Victories over Me.</p>
               <p>Though their Sin be proſperous, yet they had need to be penitent, that they may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Both which I pray God they may obtain; that my Temporal Death unjuſtly inflicted by them may not be revenged by God's juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Eternal Death upon them: for I look upon the Temporal Deſtruction of the greateſt King as far leſs deprecable than the Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the meaneſt Subject.</p>
               <p>Nor do I wiſh other than the ſafe bringing of the Ship to ſhore, when they have caſt Me over-board: though it be very ſtrange, that Mariners can ſind no other means to appeaſe the Storm themſelves have raiſed, but by drowning their Pilot.</p>
               <p>I thank God, my Enemies Cruelty cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my Preparation; whoſe Malice in this I ſhall defeat, that they ſhall not have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have deſtroyed my Soul with my Body: of whoſe Salvation while ſome of them
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104649:163"/>have themſelves ſeemed and taught others to deſpair, they have only diſcovered this, that they do not much deſire it.</p>
               <p>Whoſe uncharitable and cruel Reſtraints, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Me even the aſſiſtance of any of my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, hath rather enlarged than any way obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my acceſs to the Throne of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where Thou dwelleſt, O King of Kings, who filleſt Heaven and Earth, who art the fountain of Eternal Life, in whom is no ſhadow of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou, O God, art both the juſt Inflicter of Death upon us, and the merciful Saviour of us in it and from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea it is better for us to be dead to our ſelves, and live in Thee, than by living in our ſelves to be deprived of Thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O make the many bitter aggravations of my Death, as a Man and a King, the opportunities and advantages of thy ſpecial Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in my Soul, as a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Thou, Lord, wilt be with Me, I ſhall neither fear nor feel any evil, though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To contend with Death, is the work of a weak
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:104649:164"/>and mortal man; to overcome it, is the Grace of Thee alone, who art the Almighty and Immortal God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O my Saviour, who knoweſt what it is to die with Me as a man, make Me to know what it is to paſs through Death to Life with Thee my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though I die, yet I know that Thou my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveſt for ever: though Thou ſlayeſt Me, yet Thou haſt incouraged Me to truſt in Thee for Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O withdraw not thy Favour from Me, which is better than Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O be not far from Me, for I know not how near a violent and Cruel Death is to Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As thy Omniſcience, O God, diſcovers, ſo thy Omnipotence can defeat the Deſigns of thoſe who have, or ſhall conſpire my Deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O ſhew Me the goodneſs of thy Will, through the wickedneſs of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou giveſt Me leave, as a man, to pray that this Cup may paſs from Me; but Thou haſt taught Me, as a Chriſtian, by the example of Chriſt, to add,</hi> Not My will, but Thine be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, Lord, let our wills be one, by wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:104649:164"/>Mine into Thine: let not the deſire of Life in Me be ſo great, as that of doing or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Will in either Life or Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As I believe Thou haſt forgiven all the Errours of my Life, ſo I hope Thou wilt ſave Me from the Terrours of my Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make Me content to leave the Worlds Nothing, that I may come really to enjoy All in Thee, who haſt made Chriſt unto Me in Life Gain, and in Death Advantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though my Deſtroyers forget their Duty to Thee and Me; yet do not Thou, O Lord, forget to be merciful to them.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou madeſt thy Son a Saviour to many that crucified Him, while at once He ſuffered violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them, and yet willingly for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O let the voice of his Blood be heard for My Murtherers, louder than the Cry of Mine againſt them.</hi>

               <p>
